<s> that's true <s/>
<s> i'm good with that <s/>
<s> check out my birthday haul <s/>
<s> wow that's a lot of cash <s/>
<s> my relatives were really generous <s/>
<s> what are you gonna buy with it <s/>
<s> well i'm going to save half of it <s/>
<s> you could buy so much with this <s/>

<s> i'm going to stretch this money <s/>
<s> how are you going to do that <s/>
<s> i'm going to buy used games instead <s/>
<s> well i guess a used game is better than nothing <s/>
<s> why is there so much crime <s/>
<s> because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong <s/>
<s> is that it <s/>
<s> also there aren't enough police <s/>
<s> but there are a lot of police <s/>
<s> there's only one police officer per 100 criminals <s/>
<s> can't we hire more police <s/>
<s> it costs too much money <s/>

<s> so it would be cheaper to hire more police <s/>
<s> yes it would <s/>

<s> i don't like riding the bus <s/>
<s> the seats and windows are dirty <s/>

<s> then you can wipe your seat and window <s/>
<s> people will think i'm strange <s/>

<s> he's rude and he yells a lot <s/>
<s> that's hard to take <s/>
<s> i've never heard him say please or thank you <s/>
<s> he sounds like a real jerk <s/>
<s> no one at work likes him <s/>
<s> can't you report him to his supervisor <s/>
<s> of course not <s/>
<s> if i do that i'll lose my job <s/>
<s> yes they don't like troublemakers or complainers <s/>

<s> i had the worst date the other night <s/>

<s> first of all he was half an hour late <s/>
<s> that's not a good start <s/>
<s> then he didn't bother to apologize <s/>

<s> then he drove too fast to the restaurant <s/>
<s> that's dangerous <s/>
<s> i thought about getting out and taking a taxi home <s/>

<s> i'm doing well <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> are you here for our workshop today <s/>
<s> yes as a matter of fact i am <s/>
<s> that's wonderful <s/>
<s> this will help quite a bit <s/>
<s> will you be giving the workshop <s/>
<s> yes i will with a couple of my colleagues <s/>
<s> how many people are you expecting <s/>
<s> not many unfortunately <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> everyone should attend if possible <s/>
<s> this makes filing so easy <s/>
<s> i'll tell my friend joseph <s/>
<s> he's coming tomorrow <s/>
<s> i love it when people fall on the red carpet <s/>
<s> why would you like watching that <s/>
<s> it's funny to see someone famous fall <s/>
<s> i think it's mean to laugh at anyone falling <s/>
<s> you laughed at me when i fell last time <s/>
<s> well how would you like it if you fell on national tv <s/>
<s> i guess that would be embarrassing <s/>
<s> you should always put yourself in others' shoes <s/>
<s> i still think it's pretty funny though <s/>
<s> haven't you learned your lesson <s/>
<s> if i fell on national tv i'd be the first person to laugh <s/>
<s> i guess that's a good attitude to have <s/>
<s> can i borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture <s/>
<s> you're so lazy <s/>
<s> what are you talking about <s/>
<s> i was sick yesterday <s/>
<s> i don't care <s/>
<s> ask someone else <s/>
<s> you're so mean <s/>
<s> i can't let anyone borrow my class notes <s/>
<s> they're just notes <s/>
<s> i let a classmate borrow my notes once and she sold copies to people <s/>
<s> that's crazy <s/>
<s> for how much <s/>
<s> she sold each class note set for $5 <s/>
<s> don't worry i promise not to sell your notes <s/>
<s> i can't take your word for it <s/>
<s> i want to go to the ball game <s/>
<s> is there a game tonight <s/>
<s> yes it starts at 7 pm <s/>
<s> can we get tickets <s/>
<s> yes but only the cheap tickets <s/>
<s> how much are they <s/>
<s> theyâ’re only $5 each <s/>
<s> thatâ’s a good price <s/>
<s> yes itâ’s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer <s/>
<s> where are the seats <s/>
<s> theyâ’re behind the outfield <s/>
<s> maybe we can catch a home run ball <s/>
<s> there's a huge rip here <s/>
<s> but there's tape on it <s/>
<s> did you put the tape there <s/>
<s> no it was there before <s/>
<s> i know you're lying to me <s/>
<s> if you know then why did you ask if i put the tape on <s/>
<s> i wanted to see if you were a liar or not <s/>
<s> how did you know i'm lying <s/>
<s> before you check out the book the librarian checks it for damage <s/>
<s> wow you guys think of everything <s/>
<s> anyways you owe $10 <s/>
<s> fine here you go <s/>
<s> how long have we've been waiting for this bus <s/>
<s> almost one hour <s/>
<s> i think it's late <s/>
<s> it is late <s/>
<s> what is taking this bus driver so long to get here <s/>
<s> probably traffic <s/>
<s> you know how traffic could be on the weekends <s/>
<s> that is not a good excuse <s/>
<s> bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic <s/>
<s> that's easy for you to say <s/>
<s> i just want the bus to arrive already <s/>
<s> i want to go home <s/>
<s> it's bound to arrive any minute now <s/>
<s> i hope you're right <s/>
<s> my patience has all extinguished <s/>
<s> i think i see it coming in the distance <s/>
<s> thank goodness <s/>
<s> i couldn't possibly wait another minute <s/>
<s> false alarm <s/>
<s> it was just a truck <s/>
<s> sorry about that <s/>
<s> good day thomas <s/>
<s> we have an offer on your house <s/>
<s> that's good <s/>
<s> i hope it's better than the last one <s/>
<s> it is thomas <s/>
<s> okay let's hear it <s/>
<s> the offer is $275000 <s/>
<s> that's $35000 under the listing <s/>
<s> i know thomas but i think we should consider it <s/>
<s> why would i consider this price <s/>
<s> we should counteroffer <s/>
<s> i think we can work with this buyer <s/>
<s> i won't take less than $300000 <s/>
<s> you know that <s/>
<s> let's consider the counteroffer <s/>
<s> the house has issues <s/>
<s> okay i listen to you <s/>
<s> mr lee the seller has made a counteroffer on his home <s/>
<s> he did not accept my original offer <s/>
<s> technically he did but he has conditions <s/>
<s> okay what are they <s/>
<s> he said your offer of $325000 was a bit short <s/>
<s> what's his counteroffer <s/>
<s> he wants $335000 and he'll throw in the appliances <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> will the appliances have a warranty <s/>
<s> no warranty <s/>
<s> i'm going to have to think about this ms phillips <s/>
<s> take your time <s/>
<s> counteroffers are common <s/>
<s> i need to talk to my wife about this <s/>
<s> i'll get back to you <s/>
<s> what brings you into my examination room today <s/>
<s> i'm here because your receptionist told me i needed to come in to discuss my test results <s/>
<s> well let me take a look at your file <s/>
<s> the receptionist made me nervous when she wouldn't tell me the results over the phone <s/>
<s> legally she can't tell you the results <s/>
<s> so is it bad doctor <s/>
<s> your cholesterol is a little high <s/>
<s> does that mean i'm going to die <s/>
<s> let's not exaggerate <s/>
<s> i'm going to be okay <s/>
<s> if you change your diet and exercise more you will be fine <s/>
<s> i will do whatever it takes to be healthy <s/>
<s> i don't believe the art world <s/>
<s> what is it this time <s/>
<s> an andy warhol drawing <s/>
<s> he's a famous artist <s/>
<s> he drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant <s/>
<s> did he sign it <s/>
<s> is it beautiful <s/>
<s> it's just black ink on a white napkin <s/>
<s> and the napkin has food stains <s/>
<s> so it's not worth much <s/>
<s> only about $30000 <s/>
<s> without the food stains it would probably be worth more <s/>
<s> c'mon guess what <s/>
<s> i don't know chicken butt <s/>
<s> stop playing games <s/>
<s> i got the part in the school play <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> all this practice is finally paying off <s/>

<s> i'm going to be the main character <s/>
<s> i'm so proud of you <s/>
<s> i can't wait to see the play <s/>

<s> get me a ticket <s/>
<s> i want to be sitting in the front row <s/>
<s> i see that former president bush is at a conference <s/>
<s> he's telling jokes about his eight years as president <s/>
<s> yes those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone <s/>
<s> only 4000 american soldiers were killed overseas <s/>
<s> not to mention 40000 wounded soldiers <s/>
<s> but bush visited some of them in the hospital once <s/>
<s> that's nice that he found the time to make a visit <s/>
<s> he spoke to them and made them feel better <s/>
<s> did he speak to every family that lost a soldier <s/>
<s> no he didn't have time to do that <s/>
<s> well he's got plenty of time now <s/>
<s> no he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president <s/>
<s> it's been so long since i've seen you <s/>
<s> you haven't changed a bit <s/>
<s> oh stop lying <s/>
<s> i've gained a little weight <s/>
<s> we all have gained some weight <s/>

<s> you always had an independent spirit <s/>
<s> it's going really well so far <s/>
<s> i'd love to hear more about it over a cup of coffee <s/>
<s> the city is buying guns <s/>
<s> what are they paying <s/>
<s> up to $200 for each gun no questions asked <s/>
<s> why are they doing this <s/>
<s> they want to get guns off the street <s/>
<s> who would turn in a gun for $200 <s/>
<s> that isn't a good deal <s/>
<s> a good gun costs $400 or more <s/>
<s> well if you bring your receipt maybe they'll give you $400 <s/>
<s> i'll keep my receipt and my gun <s/>
<s> i didn't know you had a gun <s/>
<s> everyone in america should have a gun <s/>
<s> bears are invading our neighborhoods <s/>
<s> of course they are <s/>
<s> they're starving to death <s/>

<s> there's no food in the woods <s/>
<s> can't they eat grass <s/>
<s> do you think a bear is a cow <s/>
<s> well i've seen them eating berries <s/>
<s> berries aren't in season all year round <s/>
<s> it's too dangerous for kids and pets <s/>
<s> people need to cover their trash cans <s/>
<s> the police need to shoot all the bears <s/>
<s> you don't solve a problem by shooting it <s/>
<s> tv news is so stupid <s/>
<s> they shouldn't even call it news <s/>

<s> last week they told us about a bear in a back yard <s/>
<s> last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant <s/>
<s> the weatherman tells us the temperature in every town <s/>
<s> the sports guy shows us players fighting <s/>
<s> they always tell us what's next <s/>
<s> they always make what's next sound exciting but it never is <s/>
<s> it's more like news for kids <s/>
<s> they should have kid reporters <s/>
<s> i need to wash my clothes <s/>

<s> that saves a lot of money <s/>
<s> i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar <s/>
<s> that's a good deal <s/>
<s> yes even though some of the potatoes had eyes <s/>
<s> just put them in the fridge <s/>
<s> also i bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee <s/>

<s> i mixed them together <s/>
<s> if the coffee still tastes okay that's a good idea <s/>
<s> i think your grading policy is unfair <s/>
<s> i beg your pardon <s/>
<s> why is a 90% a b <s/>
<s> i'm trying to challenge you guys <s/>
<s> that's not a challenge that's a punishment <s/>

<s> that doesn't count <s/>
<s> it sure seems to count when i help pay the bills <s/>
<s> you know i pay more bills than you do <s/>
<s> that's because you make more money than i do <s/>
<s> this is why you should make dinner <s/>
<s> you are so sexist <s/>
<s> way to get off topic <s/>
<s> this is about you not making dinner <s/>
<s> we can make dinner together or order in <s/>
<s> what's the point of you working from home but won't take care of the home <s/>

<s> screw you <s/>
<s> i ain't payin $5 <s/>
<s> i guess you'll never borrow another book magazine or video here ever again <s/>
<s> it's okay because i don't even like this library <s/>

<s> we need to save money <s/>

<s> that's why we need to save money <s/>
<s> how much do we need to save <s/>
<s> we need to save enough for a down payment <s/>

<s> how much do i need to insert here to make one copy <s/>
<s> it depends <s/>
<s> do you want your copy in color or black and white <s/>
<s> i want it in color <s/>

<s> that's kind of expensive <s/>
<s> yeah but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own <s/>
<s> i have one but it's broken <s/>
<s> that sucks <s/>
<s> well if money's an issue you can copy your stuff in black and white <s/>
<s> no it has to be color <s/>
<s> do you really not have 20 cents <s/>
<s> i do but i'm really cheap <s/>
<s> well you don't really have a choice at this point <s/>
<s> my car is dirty <s/>
<s> why don't you wash it <s/>
<s> that's what i'm going to do <s/>

<s> of course <s/>
<s> it's not a hard job <s/>
<s> i'll help you <s/>
<s> okay i'll get a bucket <s/>
<s> i'll rinse the car first <s/>
<s> then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap <s/>
<s> after that we can dry it with a towel <s/>
<s> then it will look like new <s/>
<s> and you save $10 <s/>
<s> oh no another pimple on my face <s/>
<s> pimples suck <s/>
<s> it seems like i get a new pimple almost every day <s/>
<s> maybe it's something in your diet <s/>
<s> no i eat the same things day after day <s/>
<s> then maybe it's in your genes <s/>
<s> you might be right <s/>
<s> do pimples run in your family <s/>
<s> not that i've noticed <s/>
<s> well maybe it's from the pollution in the air <s/>
<s> whatever the cause i hate seeing them on my face <s/>
<s> well on the bright side they're fun to pop <s/>

<s> he wants me to start taking on more responsibilities <s/>
<s> well that will do it <s/>
<s> it's not easy managing a home <s/>
<s> i guess not but i won't be living in it now <s/>
<s> so what's he doing <s/>
<s> he's just doing a quit claim deed <s/>
<s> what's that <s/>
<s> it's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home <s/>

<s> it's usually done between family members <s/>
<s> this is it <s/>
<s> we can move in starting tomorrow <s/>
<s> we cleared escrow <s/>

<s> do it in the morning and before you go to bed <s/>
<s> i was going to be a doctor <s/>
<s> what happened to your plans <s/>

<s> it's not the same as being there <s/>
<s> it sure is windy today <s/>
<s> paper is flying everywhere <s/>
<s> this wind is dangerous for drivers <s/>
<s> especially for drivers of big trucks <s/>
<s> the wind blows those trucks over <s/>
<s> it blows trees over too <s/>
<s> a tree fell onto my dad's car <s/>
<s> was there much damage <s/>

<s> is it true that opera is sung in a foreign language <s/>
<s> yes usually in italian or french <s/>
<s> how are we supposed to know what's going on <s/>
<s> the actors also tell the story with their actions <s/>
<s> it seems a bit confusing to me <s/>
<s> the music is supposed to be beautiful regardless <s/>
<s> are they accompanied by an orchestra <s/>
<s> yes a very large one with talented performers <s/>
<s> i suppose the music will tell a story too <s/>

<s> i think republican mayors have been good for our city <s/>
<s> there's too much inequality <s/>
<s> you think this new mayor will change that <s/>
<s> you bet he will <s/>
<s> it was his campaign promise <s/>
<s> politicians make promises all the time <s/>
<s> it doesn't mean anything <s/>
<s> i think you're wrong <s/>
<s> mark my words <s/>
<s> this will mean more crime <s/>
<s> crime has been going down all over the country <s/>
<s> thanks to the democrats <s/>

<s> they call him father dollar bill <s/>
<s> yes he was on the tv news today <s/>
<s> every easter sunday he gives away money <s/>
<s> is it his money <s/>

<s> that's a terrible reason not to transfer <s/>
<s> no it's a good one <s/>
<s> i feel at home here <s/>
<s> sometimes a new environment is necessary <s/>
<s> no i really like it here <s/>

<s> i don't even know what that is like <s/>
<s> there hasn't been a democrat running this city in a long time <s/>
<s> i hope he will live up to all his campaign promises <s/>
<s> the mayor elect is really sincere <s/>

<s> this is really going to turn the city around <s/>
<s> how will that happen <s/>
<s> are your kidding <s/>
<s> there will be better schools <s/>
<s> the school system is pretty bad right now <s/>
<s> there will also be more affordable housing <s/>
<s> the city sure could use that <s/>
<s> i want to move to new york <s/>
<s> to the state or the city <s/>
<s> to the city of course <s/>
<s> why do you want to move there <s/>
<s> because i want to make a lot of money <s/>

<s> i will keep knocking on doors <s/>
<s> all you will get is sore knuckles <s/>

<s> i can put you on the stand-by list <s/>
<s> what does that mean <s/>

<s> alright you win <s/>
<s> i'll lower the price <s/>
<s> old movies are the best <s/>

<s> i know but it's worth it <s/>
<s> tell me that when i'm partying and you're not <s/>
<s> how many classes are you taking <s/>
<s> you're funny <s/>
<s> i'm taking three <s/>
<s> that's so little <s/>
<s> don't you feel like an underachiever <s/>
<s> remind me again why we're friends <s/>
<s> i can't find the jasmine rice <s/>
<s> isn't it in the rice section <s/>
<s> no they don't have it here <s/>
<s> let's check again <s/>
<s> is it this one <s/>
<s> no that's short grain white rice <s/>
<s> what about this one <s/>
<s> it's longer <s/>
<s> no that's brown rice <s/>
<s> how are we supposed to find jasmine rice <s/>
<s> oh i see more rice in another isle <s/>
<s> i found it in the international section <s/>
<s> i find it funny that americans think this rice is exotic <s/>
<s> but americans call everything different exotic <s/>
<s> having a new president will change the course of history <s/>
<s> why do you say that <s/>
<s> well obama was our first black president <s/>
<s> now we have our first woman <s/>
<s> you think gender matters that much <s/>
<s> absolutely <s/>
<s> women view things differently <s/>
<s> you don't think she'll be too soft on foreign policy <s/>
<s> look how she handled things as secretary of state <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> she was tough but also sympathetic <s/>
<s> we need someone who is more than just tough <s/>
<s> i worry about people being too tough on her <s/>
<s> she was a first lady so she knows the ins and outs <s/>
<s> she definitely has experience <s/>
<s> i need a cab to the theater district <s/>
<s> we can get that for you right away <s/>
<s> well i don't need to be there for another hour <s/>
<s> would you like to reserve a limo then <s/>
<s> that seems a bit much for me <s/>
<s> just a regular cab is fine <s/>
<s> we can't reserve a taxi that far in advance sir <s/>
<s> so how do i get a cab in an hour then <s/>
<s> if you go right outside our lobby when you are ready a staff member will hail one for you <s/>
<s> do i have to tip the guy who gets the cab for me <s/>
<s> tips aren't mandatory but they are appreciated <s/>
<s> maybe i'll just hail the cab myself then <s/>
<s> that's also an option <s/>
<s> i think i'm ready to sign the lease <s/>
<s> let me just go over some key points <s/>
<s> if you feel the need to do so then go ahead <s/>
<s> by signing this contract you are agreeing to rent the apartment for a certain amount of time <s/>
<s> yes i am aware of this <s/>
<s> the lease is for one year <s/>
<s> are you ready to make that commitment <s/>
<s> yes i am <s/>
<s> what else <s/>
<s> no pets in the apartment <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> i have no pets <s/>
<s> there'll be a late fee of $20 if you don't pay on time <s/>
<s> i have no problem with that <s/>
<s> where do i sign <s/>
<s> write your signature here and your initials here and here <s/>
<s> i need to get into downtown as quickly as possible <s/>
<s> we have many ground transportation options <s/>
<s> i don't want to have to share a car with anyone <s/>
<s> then a taxi would probably be the best option <s/>
<s> where can i get a taxi <s/>
<s> there is a special taxi line right outside the revolving doors <s/>
<s> how much is that going to cost me <s/>
<s> the city taxis have a meter so you pay by the mile <s/>
<s> does the fare include the tip <s/>
<s> no how much you tip is up to you <s/>
<s> does the taxi take credit cards <s/>
<s> taxis here are cash only <s/>
<s> i have to clean the house <s/>
<s> yes it's very dirty <s/>
<s> you can help me <s/>
<s> because you helped make it dirty <s/>
<s> what do you want me to do <s/>
<s> i want you to clean the bathroom <s/>
<s> oh that's easy <s/>
<s> clean the sink the tub the counter and the toilet <s/>
<s> that's a lot of work <s/>
<s> tell me when you finish <s/>
<s> i don't think so <s/>
<s> you'll just give me more work <s/>
<s> are you locked out of your apartment <s/>
<s> it appears that i am <s/>
<s> did you forget your key inside your apartment <s/>
<s> i think i lost it somewhere in the city <s/>
<s> that's unfortunate <s/>
<s> i think i could help you <s/>
<s> do you have another key <s/>
<s> no but the landlord does <s/>
<s> he doesn't live here though <s/>
<s> i have his phone number <s/>
<s> i'll just give him a call <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> if you want i'll talk to him myself <s/>
<s> no don't worry <s/>
<s> i talk to him for you <s/>
<s> please i insist <s/>
<s> i should be the one to ask for help since i'm the one who's in need of it <s/>
<s> alright suit yourself <s/>
<s> hello mr smith <s/>
<s> it's nice to finally meet you <s/>
<s> likewise mrs jones <s/>
<s> please sit down <s/>
<s> is james in trouble again <s/>
<s> actually no he's not <s/>
<s> what's the purpose of this meeting exactly <s/>
<s> i just wanted to let you know that james is doing very well <s/>
<s> oh is that right <s/>
<s> i'm so proud <s/>
<s> he has been staying for tutoring and his marks have skyrocketed <s/>
<s> i always knew he had it in him <s/>
<s> he behaves better in the classroom too <s/>
<s> i do believe my james is growing up <s/>
<s> all children need to mature is motivation <s/>
<s> the bus is coming <s/>
<s> let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it <s/>
<s> i don't think we are going to make it <s/>
<s> you are right <s/>
<s> there it goes <s/>
<s> when will the next bus arrive <s/>
<s> according to the bus stop pamphlet it should arrive in about fifteen minutes <s/>
<s> we are going to be a bit late <s/>
<s> i hope our friends don't get impatient <s/>
<s> hopefully they'll understand <s/>
<s> it should be here any moment now <s/>
<s> here it comes <s/>
<s> get your bus pass ready to hop on board <s/>
<s> wow you really look terrible <s/>
<s> thanks a lot <s/>
<s> i really feel awful <s/>
<s> i'm a nurse so you should tell me your symptoms <s/>
<s> well to begin with my whole body aches <s/>
<s> have you taken your temperature to see if you have a fever <s/>
<s> i have and i'm running a slight fever <s/>
<s> sounds like you may have the flu <s/>
<s> that's impossible because i got my flu shot <s/>
<s> you can still get the flu even if you get vaccinated <s/>
<s> well that makes getting the vaccine pointless <s/>
<s> not really because you will probably get over it quickly <s/>
<s> i'm going to make some tea and lie down <s/>
<s> good afternoon <s/>
<s> jet office products <s/>
<s> hello my name is richard lee <s/>
<s> i need to reschedule an appointment <s/>
<s> i could help you with that <s/>
<s> i have an appointment for 9 am tuesday that i need to change <s/>

<s> thank you for calling <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>

<s> that's perfect <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i'll see her then <s/>
<s> do you get pbs on tv <s/>
<s> yes everybody gets the public broadcasting system <s/>
<s> it puts me to sleep <s/>
<s> tell me about it <s/>
<s> a gardening show follows a knitting show <s/>
<s> a cooking show follows a sewing show <s/>
<s> a travel show follows another travel show <s/>
<s> i've gone around the world a dozen times already <s/>
<s> now they're adding old tv shows to the old movies <s/>
<s> i sure would like to see something interesting for a change <s/>
<s> if more people donate money pbs could offer new shows <s/>
<s> who wants to donate <s/>
<s> public tv should be free <s/>
<s> can you explain baseball to me <s/>
<s> i can try to explain the basics <s/>
<s> what do you want to know <s/>
<s> what are strikes <s/>
<s> every batter has three strikes <s/>
<s> when they get three strikes they are out <s/>
<s> okay but what about when the umpire calls a ball <s/>
<s> once an umpire calls four balls then the batter goes to first base <s/>
<s> what happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball <s/>
<s> the batter goes to first base <s/>
<s> what if someone is on first base <s/>
<s> then whoever was on first base goes to second base <s/>
<s> what's a no-hitter <s/>
<s> a no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game <s/>
<s> so that's a good thing for the pitcher <s/>
<s> yes because that means he pitched really well <s/>
<s> thank you for coming in today <s/>
<s> i'll see you next week <s/>
<s> excuse me instructor <s/>
<s> may i speak with you for a moment <s/>
<s> sure thing mr davis <s/>
<s> what can i help you with <s/>

<s> sure thing <s/>
<s> i hope everything is alright <s/>
<s> i'll see you next time <s/>
<s> you should volunteer at the library with me <s/>
<s> what's so good about volunteering there <s/>

<s> do you want to sign up <s/>
<s> yeah how do i sign up <s/>
<s> i'll get you an application <s/>
<s> excuse me; i'd like to use the warranty on my phone <s/>
<s> what do you mean use the warranty <s/>
<s> the warranty promises a new phone if this one breaks <s/>
<s> did something happen to it <s/>
<s> i dropped it and the screen cracked very badly <s/>
<s> it says here that your warranty has expired <s/>
<s> that can't be true <s/>
<s> i'm afraid it was only good for a year sir <s/>
<s> what am i supposed to do with a busted phone <s/>
<s> well if you trade it in you'll get a discount <s/>
<s> well i suppose it won't hurt <s/>
<s> i suggest you buy a longer warranty on this one sir <s/>

<s> that's no good <s/>
<s> sometimes the pain goes away and sometimes it doesn't <s/>
<s> have you seen a doctor <s/>
<s> i've been to two doctors <s/>

<s> there's no use in trying anymore <s/>
<s> i have another idea <s/>
<s> care to hear it <s/>
<s> alright i don't have any other options <s/>
<s> let me drive you to a locksmith <s/>
<s> what good will that do <s/>
<s> a locksmith can replace your key <s/>
<s> the one you have now is probably broken <s/>
<s> it's worth a try i guess <s/>
<s> there's the spirit <s/>
<s> come on let's go <s/>
<s> i don't recognize any of these streets <s/>
<s> is this your first time riding this bus <s/>
<s> no i take this bus to school every day <s/>
<s> this bus always drives by these streets <s/>
<s> are you sure this is not just a new route <s/>
<s> i'm pretty sure it's not <s/>
<s> perhaps it could be a detour <s/>
<s> perhaps you might be on the wrong bus <s/>
<s> there's no way this is the wrong bus <s/>
<s> if you don't believe me maybe you should go ask the bus driver <s/>
<s> wait i don't think i have to <s/>
<s> you're right this is the wrong bus <s/>
<s> i hate to say i told you so but i told you so <s/>
<s> how could i make such a dumb mistake <s/>
<s> you should get off on the next stop <s/>
<s> what brings you in to see me today <s/>
<s> i'm here for my annual check-up <s/>
<s> well the nurse already took your blood pressure and she said it looks a little high <s/>
<s> that could be related to my thyroid medication <s/>
<s> that could be it <s/>
<s> let me listen to your heartbeat <s/>
<s> does it sound good doctor <s/>
<s> sounds nice and strong to me <s/>
<s> i am concerned about some pain i've been having in my knee <s/>
<s> are you very physically active <s/>

<s> that puts a lot of pressure on your knees <s/>
<s> i hope i don't have to stop training <s/>
<s> let's discuss the security deposit <s/>
<s> do you have the full amount for the deposit <s/>
<s> i think i do <s/>
<s> how much was it again <s/>
<s> it was a total of $1000 <s/>
<s> can you please explain how a security deposit works <s/>
<s> you don't know <s/>
<s> i thought you did <s/>
<s> i just want to make sure i have it correct <s/>
<s> the security deposit ensures coverage for any damages you may cause to the apartment at your departure <s/>
<s> is that it or is there more to it <s/>
<s> the security deposit also could be used to help repay any owing rent you may have <s/>
<s> okay that's what i was thinking <s/>
<s> thanks for confirming that information <s/>
<s> sure thing <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>
<s> i can't study at home because my family talks so loudly <s/>

<s> yes but she looks like a man <s/>
<s> what difference does it make <s/>
<s> female singers are supposed to be pretty <s/>
<s> singers are supposed to sound good <s/>
<s> they should look good too <s/>
<s> there are lots of ugly men singers <s/>
<s> men singers don't have to look good <s/>

<s> she got an everything job <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> a team of doctors gave her a whole new face <s/>
<s> why did they do that <s/>
<s> a mad dog bit most of her face off <s/>
<s> oh that's terrible <s/>
<s> what does she look like now <s/>
<s> her face is really fat but they say the swelling will go down <s/>
<s> and then will she look normal again <s/>
<s> i guess so <s/>

<s> were you speeding <s/>
<s> no i was crossing the street <s/>
<s> were you jaywalking <s/>

<s> so why did you get a ticket <s/>
<s> the officer said the red hand was blinking <s/>

<s> are you doing anything right now <s/>
<s> it's my day off work <s/>
<s> how about i come over and show you how to check them <s/>

<s> so i don't need to replace the battery <s/>
<s> thank you so much <s/>

<s> this calls for further investigation <s/>
<s> i assure you i did not make the purchase <s/>
<s> i don't like riding the bus <s/>
<s> number one it's too slow <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> a car is faster <s/>
<s> number two it's usually late <s/>

<s> the buses are never on time <s/>
<s> number three it doesn't run 24 hours <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> buses don't run late at night <s/>
<s> number four it's too crowded <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>

<s> number five it's unsafe <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> bad guys might rob you <s/>

<s> do i have to choose a political party <s/>
<s> no that's optional but if you choose a party you can vote in certain primaries <s/>

<s> it's not everyone's party it's wanda's party <s/>
<s> i mean you can bring a fruit salad or some wine <s/>
<s> not everyone drinks wine though <s/>

<s> well make it from scratch then <s/>
<s> how do i do that <s/>

<s> what kind of an apartment are you looking for <s/>
<s> an apartment with one bedroom <s/>
<s> in what city <s/>
<s> in the city of pasadena <s/>

<s> that's a good idea <s/>
<s> i'll try that today <s/>
<s> let me know if you find any apartments <s/>
<s> alright i'll keep you in the loop <s/>
<s> good luck in your search <s/>
<s> do you have a car <s/>

<s> make sure that isn't an exit row because i don't want to have to help in an emergency <s/>
<s> are you having dinner with us tonight <s/>
<s> i'll be out of work soon <s/>
<s> okay i'm thinking of the pasta house <s/>
<s> oh that place gets crowded <s/>

<s> what time should we set the reservation for <s/>
<s> well i'll be home by 6 o'clock <s/>
<s> okay i'll make the call <s/>

<s> we can eat later if we have to <s/>
<s> i'm going to book our hotel reservation online <s/>
<s> are you going to book directly from the hotel website <s/>
<s> i think if i use a service like hotelscom it is cheaper <s/>
<s> you should compare the websites and see which gives us a better deal <s/>
<s> it asks us how many nights we are staying <s/>
<s> you are also going to have to tell them how many adults and children are staying in the room <s/>
<s> the hotelscom website compares prices for different hotels <s/>
<s> pick the one that is cheapest but has the nicest rooms <s/>
<s> how can i tell <s/>
<s> look at the pictures and also read the reviews <s/>

<s> that's funny <s/>
<s> don't all houses for sale have that <s/>
<s> no not really <s/>
<s> a lot of homes are just listed on the internet <s/>
<s> why do you want the sign then <s/>
<s> i still think it is an effective tool in selling a house <s/>
<s> okay you're the boss <s/>
<s> we'll also have a listing online so we can reach more people <s/>
<s> sounds good to me <s/>
<s> we should do well then <s/>
<s> hi i'm janet <s/>

<s> i don't even remember what color the carpet is <s/>
<s> it's blue i remember <s/>
<s> have you no shame <s/>
<s> what should i be ashamed of <s/>
<s> there are clothes all over the ground <s/>
<s> it's just easier to leave them there <s/>
<s> your floor is not a gigantic closet <s/>
<s> i never said it was <s/>
<s> clean your room or you can't go out today <s/>
<s> fine fine <s/>
<s> i'll clean it now <s/>
<s> all the tv stations are going to go digital <s/>

<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> i can't get a single channel <s/>
<s> do you have a digital tv <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> but i don't have cable <s/>
<s> you don't need to have cable but you do need a good antenna <s/>
<s> but i have rabbit ears <s/>

<s> what happened to the other student <s/>
<s> he landed on the hood of the car <s/>
<s> did he get off the hood <s/>
<s> no the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood <s/>
<s> i'll bet the car continued on its way <s/>
<s> of course it did <s/>
<s> why stop after you've run over two people <s/>
<s> i hope they find them and put them in jail for life <s/>
<s> i hope i can find a job after graduation <s/>

<s> what makes you say that <s/>
<s> you're smart and likeable <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> thanks but i'm still scared <s/>
<s> you should go to the job fair <s/>
<s> we have that here <s/>
<s> take advantage of it <s/>
<s> have you ever been there <s/>
<s> yes and it's really helpful <s/>
<s> dress nicely <s/>
<s> have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere <s/>
<s> no i'm sorry <s/>
<s> where did you last leave it <s/>
<s> i thought it was in my pocket <s/>
<s> is that where you last put it <s/>
<s> yeah i'm pretty sure <s/>
<s> think hard <s/>
<s> where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket <s/>
<s> i was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen <s/>
<s> maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning <s/>
<s> i think i did empty my pockets <s/>
<s> there you go <s/>
<s> i knew it <s/>
<s> i remember now <s/>
<s> my keys are on the kitchen counter <s/>
<s> that's a relief <s/>
<s> what's your policy towards owning pets in the apartment <s/>
<s> i usually don't permit any kind of pets <s/>
<s> would you be willing to make an exception <s/>
<s> it depends on the pet <s/>
<s> are you a pet owner <s/>
<s> i have a few rabbits and hamsters <s/>
<s> how many exactly <s/>
<s> i have two rabbits and three hamsters <s/>
<s> as long as you keep them inside your apartment i don't see why they would be a problem <s/>
<s> i'm guessing cats and dogs are not permitted <s/>
<s> not they are not <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to say <s/>
<s> did something happen that made you change your policy towards cats and dogs <s/>
<s> a tenant previously owned a dog and the dog attacked another tenant one day <s/>
<s> did you hear about joseph and michelle <s/>
<s> no what happened <s/>
<s> did they have a divorce <s/>
<s> they are pregnant <s/>
<s> how far along is michelle <s/>
<s> joseph told me that she is four months <s/>
<s> how is he handling the news <s/>
<s> he was a mess the last time i saw him <s/>
<s> how is he now <s/>
<s> is he still crazy <s/>
<s> actually he seems relaxed and collected <s/>
<s> i can't believe joseph is going to be a father <s/>
<s> it's trippy huh <s/>
<s> he is our age <s/>
<s> this is making me feel really old <s/>
<s> what are some of the best things to see in this city <s/>
<s> if you want to go sightseeing we have a tour that leaves from the hotel <s/>
<s> i'd rather explore the city on my own <s/>
<s> in that case i can give you a map that highlights some of the best things to see <s/>
<s> that sounds perfect <s/>
<s> the map also has coupons attached for some restaurants and shops near the landmarks <s/>
<s> i love a bargain <s/>
<s> you can walk around the city but i'll also give you a subway map in case you want to take the train <s/>
<s> the subway looks scary in the movies and on tv <s/>
<s> it isn't scary at all <s/>
<s> can i get a subway pass from you <s/>
<s> no you'll have to buy that at the train station <s/>
<s> i'm checking out but is there a place i can store my luggage for a few hours <s/>
<s> why do you need us to hold your luggage sir <s/>
<s> my flight doesn't leave for another four hours <s/>
<s> we can hold your luggage but there is an additional cost associated with that service <s/>
<s> how much is it going to cost me <s/>
<s> it will be $6 an hour <s/>
<s> i'm going to drink at your hotel bar <s/>
<s> can you hook me up <s/>
<s> unfortunately sir we cannot <s/>
<s> shall i take your credit card <s/>
<s> no forget it <s/>
<s> it's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport <s/>
<s> those airport lockers are not always safe though <s/>
<s> i'll take my chances <s/>
<s> good luck with that sir <s/>
<s> top of the morning to you mr bus driver <s/>
<s> hi good morning <s/>
<s> where are you off to today <s/>
<s> it's my first day of college <s/>
<s> wow you must be very excited <s/>
<s> you have no idea how much i am <s/>
<s> do you know how to get there <s/>
<s> it's actually just a bus ride away <s/>
<s> are you planning on taking the bus routinely <s/>
<s> yes i am <s/>
<s> why to spend money on gas when i could take the bus for less <s/>
<s> you know as a student you're eligible to receive a discount <s/>
<s> no kidding <s/>
<s> how much is the discount <s/>
<s> are you paying for a month pass <s/>
<s> yes it cost fifty dollars <s/>
<s> well with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less <s/>
<s> thirty dollars for a month pass <s/>
<s> that's quite a discount <s/>
<s> you should take advantage of it <s/>
<s> we think your leg may be broken <s/>
<s> how will you know for sure <s/>
<s> we're going to take you to radiology to get it x-rayed now <s/>
<s> will the x-ray hurt <s/>
<s> it's a pain free procedure that allows us to take a picture of your bones <s/>
<s> are there any side effects associated with taking an x-ray <s/>
<s> diagnostic x-rays are safe as long as they are not overused <s/>
<s> i've never had an x-ray in my entire life <s/>
<s> then you should be fine <s/>
<s> can someone be in the room with me <s/>
<s> someone can be in the room with you but not next to you during the x-ray <s/>
<s> please go get my wife then <s/>
<s> i am so sick of dining hall food <s/>
<s> it's so unhealthy <s/>
<s> we should go to a restaurant nearby <s/>

<s> i like it <s/>
<s> do they sell nuts <s/>
<s> i'm not sure <s/>
<s> anyways i want to try their organic tofu <s/>
<s> i'm allergic to tofu <s/>
<s> that's okay <s/>
<s> they serve a wide variety of food <s/>
<s> i'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food <s/>
<s> hello this is my first time here <s/>
<s> i could use some help <s/>
<s> okay i can help <s/>

<s> well i need something from you before i can allow you to do that <s/>
<s> what do you need from me <s/>
<s> i will need you to fill out this form and show me identification <s/>
<s> okay i'll do that <s/>
<s> i can then search your database <s/>
<s> you'll need to ask for permission <s/>
<s> here's the form and my id <s/>
<s> wonderful <s/>
<s> you can ask mr lee for permission now <s/>
<s> that's super <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>
<s> good luck <s/>
<s> what happened to your car <s/>
<s> i got a dent in the parking lot <s/>
<s> how did you get it <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> maybe it was from a shopping cart <s/>
<s> those shopping carts are dangerous <s/>
<s> especially the metal ones <s/>
<s> i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts <s/>
<s> that's a good idea but there was a good sale at this store <s/>
<s> did you save any money on the sale <s/>
<s> yes i did <s/>
<s> i saved about $50 <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> yes except this dent will cost about $150 <s/>
<s> i think these puppies are hungry <s/>
<s> they've done nothing but play all day <s/>
<s> do you think they're old enough to eat kibble <s/>
<s> they're six weeks old; i think they're old enough <s/>
<s> they're digging right in <s/>
<s> now they're settling for a nap <s/>
<s> between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning they're a hassle <s/>
<s> yeah they are <s/>
<s> but look how cute they are while asleep <s/>
<s> suddenly i don't mind the chores so much <s/>
<s> yeah neither do i <s/>
<s> these puppies are truly worth it <s/>
<s> i wouldn't lose a single minute with them <s/>
<s> can i ask you a question <s/>
<s> sure go ahead <s/>
<s> how is your relationship with your parents <s/>
<s> it's good <s/>
<s> i get along with my father more than i do with my mother <s/>
<s> if i may ask why is that <s/>
<s> i'm not comfortable answering that <s/>
<s> why are you asking <s/>
<s> it's for a class project <s/>
<s> why don't you get along with your mother <s/>
<s> what class are you doing this for <s/>
<s> it's for my psychology class <s/>
<s> do you live with your dad or mom <s/>
<s> i live with my dad <s/>
<s> do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom <s/>
<s> i said i'm not comfortable talking about that <s/>
<s> change the subject <s/>
<s> it's sunday <s/>
<s> you know what that means <s/>
<s> sunday means we go to church <s/>
<s> put on a coat and tie <s/>
<s> to show respect to god and others <s/>
<s> i'm glad sunday is only once a week <s/>
<s> i hope god didn't hear that <s/>
<s> he'll forgive me <s/>
<s> i'm locked out again <s/>
<s> did i overhear you say what i think you just said <s/>
<s> that i'm locked out <s/>
<s> yes that's what i said <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to hear that <s/>
<s> how did you lock yourself out <s/>
<s> i'm pretty sure i left my key inside the apartment <s/>
<s> that happened to me before <s/>
<s> what did you do when it happened <s/>
<s> i climbed into the window to unlock the door <s/>
<s> that doesn't sound like such a bad idea <s/>
<s> unless you have a spare key <s/>
<s> it seems i'm going to have to break into my own apartment <s/>
<s> be careful not to break anything <s/>
<s> is that what you did when you did the same <s/>
<s> accidentally yes i did <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but today's bus tour has been canceled because of the weather <s/>
<s> now what am i supposed to do <s/>
<s> the hotel's concierge will be happy to find you tickets to a local theater production <s/>
<s> i'm not really a theater person <s/>
<s> how about we get you reservations to one of the city's finest restaurants <s/>
<s> that sounds good <s/>
<s> what kind of food do you like <s/>
<s> i love seafood especially lobster <s/>
<s> i'll book you a table at the lobster shack restaurant then <s/>
<s> will the hotel provide transportation <s/>
<s> we can get you a cab <s/>
<s> i'd prefer a limo <s/>
<s> everything seems to be in order <s/>
<s> i'm ready to move into the apartment <s/>
<s> good i welcome you to your new home <s/>
<s> is there anything else i should know before i start my move <s/>
<s> now that you mention it yes there is <s/>
<s> it's the policy i have on pets <s/>
<s> do you allow any kind of pets <s/>
<s> only caged pets i'm sorry to say <s/>
<s> i hope this won't be a problem <s/>
<s> actually i might prove to be problematic because i have a cat <s/>
<s> there lies the problem <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but some of the other tenants have allergies to cats <s/>
<s> that's too bad <s/>
<s> i don't know what i'm going to do with the kitten <s/>
<s> perhaps you can give it away <s/>
<s> do you know of anyone who might want a cat <s/>
<s> no not really <s/>
<s> what about you <s/>
<s> would you like a cat <s/>
<s> well i've never owned a pet before let alone a cat <s/>
<s> cats make great companions <s/>
<s> please take mine <s/>
<s> you would be doing me a huge favor <s/>
<s> alright why not <s/>
<s> bring the little fellow next time <s/>
<s> i'm so glad you could squeeze me into your schedule today doctor <s/>
<s> sure what seems to be the problem <s/>
<s> i was in a small car accident last month but only recently noticed some neck pain <s/>
<s> is there any bruising <s/>
<s> not that i can see <s/>
<s> show me where the pain is <s/>
<s> the pain feels like a sharp stabbing followed by a dull throbbing <s/>
<s> i don't see bruising but there could be nerve damage <s/>
<s> so what do i do next <s/>
<s> i'm going to refer you to a nerve specialist <s/>
<s> do you think i can sue <s/>
<s> is that what this is all about <s/>
<s> hi i am here to buy a bus pass <s/>

<s> if you're a student you get a discount <s/>
<s> i am a student <s/>

<s> your levels are all within the normal range so just eat vitamin rich food <s/>
<s> i am trying to get pregnant <s/>

<s> that is right <s/>
<s> the cancelation will be subject to a $15 cancellation fee <s/>

<s> sounds good <s/>
<s> would you like it in a glass with ice <s/>
<s> yes that sounds wonderful <s/>
<s> we also have some slices of pineapple <s/>
<s> would you like some <s/>
<s> pineapple would hit the spot <s/>
<s> i would love some <s/>
<s> does your wife want some as well <s/>
<s> actually she doesn't like pineapple <s/>
<s> thanks anyway <s/>
<s> i can't believe today is the last day of our vacation <s/>
<s> we should shop for some souvenirs to bring back home to our friends <s/>
<s> i'd much rather we spend another day seeing the sights <s/>
<s> we can sightsee and buy souvenirs along the way <s/>
<s> why don't we just buy souvenirs at the airport <s/>
<s> the airport charges way too much for souvenirs <s/>
<s> our friends won't know the difference <s/>
<s> we will know <s/>
<s> the hotel has postcards in the lobby i think <s/>
<s> postcards are to be mailed not given as souvenirs <s/>
<s> let's go to the museum gift shop <s/>
<s> that's a great idea <s/>
<s> i'm going to be so late <s/>
<s> this bus driver is driving so slowly <s/>
<s> where are you in a hurry to <s/>
<s> i have doctor's appointment <s/>
<s> i hope i make it on time <s/>
<s> i'm sure you will <s/>
<s> where's your clinic <s/>
<s> it's in long beach <s/>
<s> i'd say we're about twenty minutes away from there <s/>
<s> i sure hope you're right about that <s/>
<s> where are you heading to <s/>
<s> i'm going to visit my grandma <s/>
<s> where does she live <s/>
<s> she's also in long beach <s/>
<s> what a coincidence <s/>
<s> do you often ride this bus to visit her <s/>
<s> i have for the past two years <s/>
<s> i visit her every sunday <s/>
<s> that's so sweet of you <s/>
<s> you must love her very much <s/>
<s> why are you going to the doctor's <s/>
<s> to get my routine check-up <s/>
<s> nothing serious <s/>
<s> it's so nice to meet friendly people on the bus <s/>
<s> why are you taking so long <s/>
<s> is something wrong <s/>
<s> sorry my bag of chips got stuck <s/>
<s> vending machines suck huh <s/>
<s> they're the worst but the food is great <s/>
<s> it might come out if someone buys an item from the same column yours is on <s/>
<s> can you be that someone <s/>
<s> sure why not <s/>
<s> i could use some chips <s/>
<s> hey what is your name <s/>
<s> my name is charlie <s/>
<s> nice to meet you charlie <s/>
<s> what is your name <s/>
<s> hater of vending machines <s/>
<s> can i help you with something <s/>
<s> yes i hope that you can <s/>
<s> what seems to be the problem <s/>
<s> do you know what time it is <s/>
<s> it's eleven o'clock at night <s/>
<s> actually it was eleven an hour ago <s/>
<s> oh you're right about that <s/>
<s> i live right next door to you and your loud music is keeping me awake <s/>
<s> is that so <s/>
<s> it's really that loud <s/>
<s> yes it is <s/>
<s> i'm going to have to ask you to lower down the noise <s/>
<s> sorry about that <s/>
<s> i'll lower down the music <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> please be a little more considerate next time <s/>
<s> again i apologize for the noise <s/>
<s> it won't happen again <s/>
<s> i sure hope it won't <s/>
<s> would it be okay if i checked the apartment for any damages <s/>
<s> that's fine with me <s/>
<s> step inside <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i'll take a quick look around <s/>
<s> feel free to take your time <s/>
<s> right away i noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile <s/>
<s> can you show me <s/>
<s> it's right at the corner next to the sink <s/>
<s> i'll have that repaired right away <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> that would be great <s/>
<s> take a carful look around the apartment and tell me of anything else that needs tending to <s/>
<s> here's something else <s/>
<s> these doors are kind of loose <s/>
<s> it's the screws on them <s/>
<s> i'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible <s/>
<s> i didn't like the way you sang tonight <s/>
<s> well thanks for coming out <s/>
<s> you didn't put in all your effort <s/>
<s> that's all i'm saying <s/>
<s> okay well i'm going to leave now <s/>
<s> why are you in a rush to leave <s/>
<s> because you are being rude and i don't want to speak to you <s/>
<s> well now i know you can't take criticism <s/>
<s> it's not that i can't take criticism; it's that i don't like jerks <s/>
<s> how am i a jerk <s/>
<s> i'm just giving you my honest opinion <s/>
<s> well in my honest opinion i don't care what you think <s/>
<s> now that was rude <s/>
<s> i don't want to talk to you anymore <s/>
<s> believe me; i won't be losing any sleep <s/>
<s> are you busy <s/>
<s> not at the moment <s/>
<s> what's going on <s/>
<s> i wanted to run something by you <s/>
<s> it's an idea for work <s/>
<s> okay shoot <s/>
<s> well i'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule <s/>
<s> what's your idea <s/>
<s> it's to change from five eight-hour days to four ten-hour days <s/>
<s> that's a big change <s/>
<s> i don't think he'll go for it <s/>
<s> it's still 40 hours per week and everyone will get an extra day off <s/>
<s> i don't think it will work <s/>
<s> it's not a good idea <s/>
<s> why is it not a good idea <s/>
<s> companies should be open five days a week <s/>
<s> sorry i don't like it <s/>
<s> i would like to purchase the book for sociology 130 <s/>
<s> may i see your student id <s/>
<s> i didn't know we needed it <s/>
<s> please go get your id and get in line again <s/>
<s> but i waited in line for two hours <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but you need a student id to purchase textbooks here <s/>
<s> are there any other options <s/>
<s> show me proof that you're a student at this college and you'll be good <s/>
<s> i have my report card <s/>
<s> here it is <s/>
<s> this will do <s/>
<s> nice grades by the way <s/>
<s> i worked very hard for them <s/>
<s> good luck with this semester <s/>
<s> officer my wallet and passport are gone <s/>
<s> we'll file a report so that no one else tries to use your passport <s/>
<s> what about my credit cards <s/>
<s> you'll have to call the credit card companies and have them cancel the cards <s/>
<s> how will i get home without a passport <s/>
<s> you can't get home without a passport <s/>
<s> so what should i do <s/>
<s> call the nearest us embassy and tell them what happened <s/>
<s> will i need to apply for a new passport <s/>
<s> most likely you will <s/>
<s> is that going to take a long time <s/>
<s> just take a copy of this police report and see if that will make the process faster <s/>
<s> i hate shaving <s/>
<s> i just cut myself again <s/>
<s> did you use a new blade <s/>
<s> it doesn't matter <s/>
<s> old blades cut new blades cut <s/>
<s> maybe you should use an electric shaver <s/>
<s> they make a lot of noise but they don't give a close shave <s/>
<s> maybe you should stop shaving <s/>
<s> and grow a beard <s/>
<s> because food and other stuff sticks in my beard <s/>
<s> here's an idea <s/>
<s> put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off <s/>
<s> in order to check for an infection we are going to need a urine sample <s/>
<s> how does that work <s/>
<s> take this little cup and pee in it <s/>
<s> do i have to fill the whole cup <s/>
<s> if you fill it half way it will be fine <s/>
<s> what do i do with the cup <s/>
<s> put it in the plastic bag and leave it on the tray in the bathroom <s/>
<s> no one else will take my sample <s/>
<s> the nurse will take it when you leave the bathroom <s/>
<s> i'm glad i drank some water while i was in the waiting room <s/>
<s> we would have given you water and waited until you need to use the bathroom <s/>
<s> you don't need to wait because i'm ready to use the bathroom now <s/>
<s> can i ask you a question <s/>
<s> what do you need to know <s/>
<s> is this bus headed toward monterey park <s/>
<s> yes it is <s/>
<s> i'm going to monterey park too <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i was just making sure <s/>
<s> i'm new to the area <s/>
<s> i've lived in this area for a while <s/>
<s> i'm visiting friends <s/>
<s> if you don't mind me asking what are you going to do <s/>
<s> i'm going to visit the markets and stores there <s/>
<s> do you recommend any restaurants in monterey park <s/>
<s> you should try the elite restaurant <s/>
<s> it's pretty good <s/>
<s> i'll be sure to check it out <s/>
<s> here comes our stop <s/>
<s> have a nice day <s/>
<s> nice talking to you <s/>
<s> do any public buses run nearby <s/>
<s> yes in fact many buses do <s/>
<s> can you tell me where i can catch them <s/>
<s> down the street the 260 bus picks you up and takes you to los angeles <s/>
<s> how frequently does it pass <s/>
<s> that bus passes every 30 minutes <s/>
<s> how much is the fare <s/>
<s> for most it's two dollars and fifty cents <s/>
<s> is it possible to buy some kind of pass for the bus <s/>
<s> yes you can <s/>
<s> there are daily weekly and monthly passes you can purchase <s/>
<s> do you know the cost of them <s/>
<s> if i'm not mistaken it's five dollars for the day twenty dollars for the week and fifty for the month <s/>
<s> you really shouldn't wear all that bling when we go sightseeing today <s/>
<s> why are you such a scared cat <s/>
<s> you look like you want to be mugged <s/>
<s> stop nagging me and walk with me to the atm so i can get a lot of cash out <s/>
<s> you should only carry what you need for the day <s/>
<s> i don't want to have to make multiple trips to the atm <s/>
<s> if you are robbed they will take everything though <s/>
<s> why are you so obsessed with crime <s/>
<s> it's just that criminals look for careless tourists <s/>
<s> you make it sound like every city is dangerous <s/>
<s> cities have good and bad things <s/>
<s> well let's enjoy the good things and not expect the worse <s/>
<s> i just read your proposal <s/>
<s> what did you think about it <s/>
<s> you definitely have some good ideas <s/>
<s> well i worked on it very hard <s/>
<s> i'm concerned about the cost though <s/>
<s> i thought you might be <s/>
<s> here's a cost analysis i ran <s/>
<s> it says here that your proposal will pay for itself in a year <s/>
<s> that's what i put in the report <s/>
<s> that's impressive <s/>
<s> if this is true i'm certain this can work <s/>
<s> i'm quite sure it will work <s/>
<s> you have done a good job <s/>
<s> we'll discuss this at our next meeting <s/>
<s> i appreciate your confidence in me <s/>
<s> do you have any tips on how to stay healthy <s/>
<s> how do you think i got to look this good at my age <s/>
<s> let me guess you drink a lot of water <s/>
<s> i drink at least eight glasses a day <s/>
<s> i bet you exercise every day too <s/>
<s> i try at the very least to walk 20 minutes a day <s/>
<s> i didn't think walking was good exercise <s/>
<s> walking briskly is great exercise <s/>
<s> what about eating habits <s/>
<s> try to eat as much non-processed stuff as possible <s/>
<s> what do you mean non-processed <s/>
<s> if it's in a can a bag or a box it's probably processed <s/>
<s> it's 4 am already <s/>
<s> i have to be getting home <s/>
<s> you can stay over if you want <s/>
<s> i have an extra bed <s/>
<s> i appreciate the gesture but i must get home <s/>
<s> do you want to hang out tomorrow night <s/>
<s> i would love that <s/>
<s> i will call you after i get out of work <s/>
<s> what time do you get out <s/>
<s> if my boss isn't there i should be getting out at around 8 <s/>
<s> and if your boss is there <s/>
<s> then i will be getting out sometime around 10 <s/>
<s> we could go grab a drink after you get out of work <s/>
<s> that sounds lovely good night <s/>
<s> good night <s/>
<s> drive home safely <s/>
<s> who do i have the pleasure to speak to this afternoon <s/>
<s> hello my name is james <s/>
<s> you've called your city's local plumber <s/>
<s> what can i do for you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i have a problem with my gas line <s/>
<s> i specialize in gas line problems <s/>

<s> i'm glad to hear that <s/>
<s> can you come to my home today <s/>
<s> i'm booked today sorry <s/>
<s> can i come tomorrow instead <s/>
<s> tomorrow works for me too <s/>

<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i have to go to downtown los angeles today <s/>
<s> are you visiting someone <s/>
<s> no i have an important job interview there <s/>
<s> how are you planning on getting there <s/>
<s> i would drive <s/>
<s> but my car overheated last night <s/>
<s> it looks like you're going to have to ride the bus <s/>
<s> i haven't ridden the bus in years <s/>
<s> i can help you out if you want <s/>
<s> that would be great <s/>
<s> what could you tell me about the bus system in los angeles <s/>
<s> speaking from experience i could tell you how efficient it is <s/>
<s> do you take the bus to los angeles frequently <s/>
<s> only every week monday through friday for the past two years <s/>
<s> your books are over the due date by one month <s/>
<s> it would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record <s/>
<s> what kind of hold is on your record <s/>
<s> a hold that won't let me go to the college football game <s/>
<s> oh that's tough <s/>
<s> my girlfriend is actually a cheerleader and so i have to go <s/>
<s> you're not going to like what i'm going to say <s/>
<s> what is it <s/>
<s> i can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee <s/>
<s> is it a technical error <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> i just can't remove it <s/>
<s> if my girlfriend breaks up with me i'm blaming you <s/>
<s> excuse me <s/>
<s> are you reading this paper <s/>
<s> help yourself <s/>
<s> i asked because the paper is sitting next to you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> that's polite of you to ask <s/>
<s> some people would just pick it up <s/>
<s> yes i know <s/>
<s> some people are rude <s/>
<s> i always try to be polite <s/>
<s> the world needs more polite people like us <s/>
<s> i agree 100 percent <s/>
<s> do you ever take public transportation to get around <s/>
<s> before i frequently did <s/>
<s> not so much anymore <s/>
<s> why do you ask <s/>
<s> i wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city <s/>
<s> i could provide you with some <s/>
<s> what would you like to know <s/>
<s> what kind of public transportation is there <s/>
<s> there is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city <s/>
<s> it does not take you outside the city <s/>
<s> unfortunately it does not <s/>
<s> but it's cheaper than other public buses that do <s/>
<s> and where is the nearest stop from here <s/>
<s> it's really close <s/>
<s> just a block away towards that direction <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> you can't miss it and you're welcome <s/>
<s> how are you <s/>
<s> i'm doing well <s/>
<s> how are you <s/>
<s> i'm fine thanks <s/>
<s> i was wondering if you read my report <s/>
<s> yes i did read your report <s/>
<s> well what did you think <s/>
<s> to be truthful i didn't like it much <s/>
<s> i don't have the time to discuss this now <s/>
<s> let's make an appointment <s/>
<s> okay but generally speaking what was wrong with it <s/>
<s> i just don't feel confident in it <s/>
<s> i can make it work <s/>
<s> all i need is time <s/>
<s> i like your enthusiasm but it's too risky sorry <s/>
<s> mom i want a puppy <s/>
<s> let me think about it <s/>
<s> why do you have to think about it <s/>
<s> because a puppy costs money <s/>
<s> no it doesn't <s/>
<s> puppies are free <s/>
<s> yes but a puppy needs shots <s/>
<s> shots for what <s/>
<s> so it won't get sick <s/>
<s> just like you get shots <s/>
<s> i hate shots <s/>
<s> and a puppy eats food <s/>
<s> food costs money <s/>
<s> no problem <s/>
<s> i'll give him food off my plate <s/>
<s> oh no you don't <s/>
<s> puppies don't eat vegetables <s/>
<s> come inside and meet my family <s/>
<s> how should i greet them <s/>
<s> they will probably want to hug you <s/>
<s> that's a little awkward <s/>
<s> it's just part of their culture <s/>
<s> anything else i should prepare myself for before going in <s/>
<s> you should accept something to eat or drink even if you are not hungry or thirsty <s/>
<s> is that part of the custom <s/>
<s> if you refuse it is considered very rude <s/>
<s> i don't want to disrespect your family <s/>
<s> you'd better not disrespect them <s/>
<s> don't worry i'll do you a solid <s/>
<s> this floor is falling apart <s/>
<s> how can you tell <s/>
<s> are you kidding me <s/>
<s> step over here <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> the floor to this apartment is badly damaged <s/>
<s> see i told you so <s/>
<s> what did you do that made the floor like this <s/>
<s> it wasn't me <s/>
<s> it was like this when i moved in here <s/>
<s> you should report this poor upkeep to the landlord <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> i'll call him the first thing in the morning <s/>
<s> be carful not to damage the floor any further <s/>
<s> i hope the landlord replaces the floor soon <s/>
<s> he probably will <s/>
<s> what do you plan to do after you graduate from here <s/>
<s> i'm planning to go to medical school <s/>
<s> i'm planning to teach english in underprivileged countries <s/>
<s> that's really kind of you <s/>
<s> the first country i'm teaching in is kenya <s/>
<s> while you're at kenya i'll be studying for medical school <s/>
<s> what kind of doctor do you want to be <s/>
<s> i want to be a pediatrician <s/>
<s> because you like kids <s/>
<s> i don't really have a good reason <s/>
<s> i just think i'll be good at it <s/>
<s> you should do what you love not necessarily what you're good at <s/>
<s> that is very cheesy advice <s/>
<s> i saw a commercial about a heart medication <s/>
<s> you don't have any heart problems <s/>
<s> i know but the ad suggested i ask my doctor if that medication was right for me <s/>
<s> as your doctor i can tell you that you don't need any heart medication <s/>
<s> okay what about this medication that has the commercial with the couple in the bathtub <s/>
<s> what about it <s/>
<s> can you prescribe that to me <s/>
<s> the only thing i am prescribing you is an antibiotic for your strep throat <s/>
<s> what do i do with this piece of paper <s/>
<s> take it to the pharmacy and the pharmacist will give you the antibiotic <s/>
<s> what if it doesn't work <s/>
<s> come back to see me again <s/>
<s> i want to get to monterey park <s/>
<s> what bus should i take <s/>
<s> if you're in maywood you can take the 260 bus on atlantic <s/>
<s> how long will it take me to get there <s/>
<s> it will take you about thirty minutes depending on traffic <s/>
<s> that's not too bad <s/>
<s> yeah it really isn't <s/>
<s> are there a lot of people on that bus <s/>
<s> the 260 bus can get pretty full except on holidays <s/>
<s> thank you for telling me <s/>
<s> no problem <s/>
<s> where are you going <s/>
<s> i'll be visiting friends <s/>
<s> that's nice <s/>
<s> i hope you have fun <s/>
<s> hello my name is george <s/>
<s> what's your name <s/>
<s> hi george i'm christine <s/>
<s> nice to meet you <s/>
<s> hi christine <s/>
<s> have you worked here long <s/>
<s> almost two years now and you <s/>
<s> this is my first week <s/>
<s> i really like it so far <s/>
<s> yes it's a good place to work <s/>
<s> i like how it seems so organized <s/>
<s> that's one of the things i like best too <s/>
<s> the benefits aren't bad either <s/>
<s> no they're not <s/>
<s> i especially like the health plan <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> i'll be eligible in july for that <s/>
<s> you're going to like it here <s/>
<s> this is the best place i've worked <s/>
<s> have you found an apartment <s/>
<s> yes i have <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> where is it at <s/>
<s> it's in downtown <s/>
<s> have you ever been there <s/>
<s> no but i hear that area could be kind of sketchy <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> the apartment is in a pretty safe part of town <s/>
<s> that's a relief <s/>
<s> when are you moving <s/>
<s> this weekend saturday <s/>
<s> have you hired any movers <s/>
<s> no i have not <s/>
<s> know any good movers <s/>
<s> sure i'll give you the number to the movers that can help you <s/>
<s> gee thanks <s/>
<s> i appreciate the favor <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>
<s> look at all these kittens <s/>
<s> how many are there <s/>
<s> they're all so cute <s/>
<s> yes but i can't keep them <s/>
<s> what are you going to do with them <s/>
<s> i'm going to give them away <s/>
<s> do you want one <s/>
<s> yes i would love one <s/>
<s> which one do you want <s/>
<s> the one that's all black <s/>
<s> yes i like that one too <s/>
<s> i'll call him blacky <s/>
<s> the parking permit is $200 per semester right <s/>
<s> it's actually $300 <s/>
<s> that's ridiculous <s/>
<s> it's because of the budget cuts <s/>
<s> that's a terrible excuse <s/>
<s> it's the truth <s/>
<s> give me something better than that <s/>
<s> miss if you don't want to pay then don't <s/>
<s> this is so stressful <s/>
<s> i advise writing a letter to the dean <s/>
<s> i bet he'll just throw it away <s/>
<s> you would be surprised <s/>
<s> the floor to my apartment is badly damaged <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to hear that <s/>
<s> how bad is it <s/>
<s> it's practically falling apart <s/>
<s> did some kind of accident cause this <s/>
<s> none that i could've made <s/>
<s> i think your previous tenant might have caused this <s/>
<s> that makes sense <s/>
<s> he took poor care of the apartment <s/>
<s> i could see that myself <s/>
<s> i'll have that fixed as soon as possible <s/>
<s> if it's not too much trouble may i request one more thing <s/>
<s> is there anything else wrong in the apartment <s/>
<s> it's just my bedroom window <s/>
<s> i can't seem to get it open <s/>
<s> i'll have that window taken care of as well <s/>
<s> where can i find the shuttle bus <s/>
<s> there're a number of shuttle buses you can take here at the airport <s/>
<s> i am looking for the shuttle bus that will take me to the rental car location <s/>
<s> those are out the doors and to the left <s/>
<s> are those shuttle buses free <s/>
<s> if you have a reservation with the car rental company they are <s/>
<s> i forgot to make a reservation <s/>
<s> the rental car companies have kiosks at the other end of the airport <s/>
<s> maybe i'll just take the shuttle bus to the subway <s/>
<s> that shuttle bus is free and is to the right when you exit <s/>
<s> is there a shuttle bus to take me all the way home <s/>
<s> there is a company that offers that for a fee <s/>
<s> how much does it cost to ride the bus <s/>
<s> the cost is one dollar and fifty cents <s/>
<s> i'm going to have to spend nearly ten dollars today on just bus fare alone <s/>
<s> why do you say that <s/>
<s> i have to take six buses in total today <s/>
<s> why so many <s/>
<s> three buses to get to where i'm going and three to get back home <s/>
<s> you should just buy a pass for the day <s/>
<s> what's that <s/>
<s> it's literally a pass that allows you to ride any bus for free <s/>
<s> wow that sounds like a good reason to buy one <s/>
<s> you definitely should <s/>
<s> you'd save money in the long run <s/>
<s> there really is no place like home even after a vacation <s/>
<s> um honey did you tell the neighbor to water the plants <s/>
<s> i thought you did <s/>
<s> what about the mail did you tell the neighbor to pick that up <s/>
<s> so i have to do everything around here <s/>
<s> what about the cat <s/>
<s> what about the cat <s/>
<s> did you get the neighbor to feed the cat while we were gone <s/>
<s> cats are pretty good at taking care of themselves <s/>
<s> i can't believe you <s/>
<s> at least no one broke into the house while we were gone <s/>
<s> thank goodness for the small miracle <s/>
<s> did you ever find a new apartment to move into <s/>
<s> yes i did <s/>
<s> the apartment is in a convenient location <s/>
<s> where is it located <s/>
<s> it is in the city of pasadena and near both my school and job <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> it seems you found the perfect place <s/>
<s> i'm glad too <s/>
<s> could i ask you for a favor <s/>
<s> what is it <s/>
<s> would you be able to help me move into my new apartment tomorrow <s/>
<s> yes i would be glad to <s/>
<s> i just need help moving my furniture in <s/>
<s> no problem <s/>
<s> i'll stop by tomorrow morning <s/>
<s> maybe we can go out for pizza right after we finish <s/>
<s> oh i am so tired <s/>
<s> i know what you mean <s/>
<s> i don't know if i can continue working like this <s/>
<s> i've been doing it a lot longer than you <s/>
<s> isn't there something we can do <s/>
<s> i have complained about the double shifts before <s/>
<s> what has management told you <s/>
<s> they said they are hiring more people and that this is temporary <s/>
<s> i need this job but i don't like these hours at all <s/>
<s> just hang in there <s/>
<s> i'm sure it will change <s/>
<s> it'd better change and the sooner the better <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> people may start leaving <s/>
<s> my parents go to church every sunday <s/>
<s> they trust in god <s/>
<s> they hope they will go to heaven <s/>
<s> they probably will <s/>
<s> but no one knows for sure <s/>
<s> that's for sure <s/>
<s> no one knows what happens after we die <s/>
<s> if we are good we will be happy in heaven with god <s/>
<s> that's what many people believe <s/>
<s> if we are bad we will be unhappy forever in hell <s/>
<s> i don't want to go to hell <s/>
<s> let's go to church with your parents on sunday <s/>
<s> do you have a car on campus <s/>
<s> no because it's hard to find parking here <s/>
<s> how do you get to places then <s/>
<s> i walk or take the bus <s/>
<s> that's crazy <s/>
<s> i could never do that <s/>
<s> you should <s/>
<s> it's great for the environment <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> what do you do for fun then <s/>
<s> there's a lot of stuff to do around campus <s/>
<s> i never realized <s/>
<s> you should do some exploring <s/>
<s> you convinced me <s/>
<s> i won't bring my car this semester <s/>
<s> we can walk to places together now <s/>
<s> i'm going to commute to school by bus this year <s/>
<s> you should consider getting a bus pass <s/>
<s> why should i buy a bus pass <s/>
<s> it's cheaper compared to manually paying every day <s/>
<s> what kind of pass do you recommend i get <s/>
<s> you should get the monthly pass <s/>
<s> how much is a monthly pass <s/>
<s> it is $64 but because you're a student you can get a student discount <s/>
<s> how much will it be with a student discount <s/>
<s> it will be 35 dollars <s/>
<s> wow that is cheap <s/>
<s> you'll need your student id <s/>
<s> i finally found an apartment to move in <s/>
<s> that's great to hear <s/>
<s> kudos to you <s/>
<s> thanks it wasn't easy finding one <s/>
<s> are you moving in soon <s/>
<s> this weekend in fact <s/>
<s> have you hired any movers <s/>
<s> no i have not <s/>
<s> don't you know of any in the area <s/>
<s> that's not the problem <s/>
<s> i don't think i have enough to afford movers <s/>
<s> that's too bad <s/>
<s> is there anything i could do to help <s/>
<s> actually i was going to ask for your help <s/>
<s> you're going to need at least one more other person to help you move <s/>
<s> you're right about that <s/>
<s> so can i count on you to help me <s/>
<s> i would be happy to help you move <s/>
<s> you know you can't park here right <s/>
<s> listen i had to talk to my friend really quickly and there was no parking spaces <s/>
<s> i'm going to have to give you a ticket <s/>
<s> i'm a broke college student <s/>
<s> and i'm a broke police officer <s/>
<s> deal with it <s/>
<s> can't you just let me off with a warning <s/>
<s> i have to be firm with you <s/>
<s> i'll buy you a box of donuts <s/>
<s> you have got to be kidding me <s/>
<s> i thought all cops liked donuts <s/>
<s> that's a stereotype <s/>
<s> you should really learn to be quiet <s/>
<s> i'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning <s/>
<s> my husband died <s/>
<s> i'm sorry for you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> when did he die <s/>
<s> a couple of months ago <s/>
<s> you still miss him <s/>
<s> yes but i talk to him almost every day <s/>
<s> when you go to church <s/>
<s> no when i call him on his cell phone <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> i buried him with his cell phone <s/>
<s> what will you do when the battery dies <s/>
<s> i know a lot of you have been working double shifts lately <s/>
<s> yes we have <s/>
<s> i am pleased to say that we have hired some help <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> when do they start <s/>
<s> one person will start next week <s/>
<s> the others will follow <s/>
<s> you promised more help last week <s/>
<s> i know i did but the search has taken longer than i thought <s/>
<s> that's terrible <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> i promise you all i'll get some help <s/>
<s> okay thanks <s/>
<s> these 16-hour days are killing us <s/>
<s> help is on the way <s/>
<s> i promise <s/>
<s> that's good enough for us <s/>
<s> i need to buy a bus pass <s/>
<s> where do you need to go <s/>
<s> i have to go to the los angeles library <s/>
<s> you need to buy a buss pass that's for sure <s/>
<s> i don't know where to buy it <s/>
<s> you've never purchased a bus pass <s/>
<s> i wouldn't be asking if i did <s/>
<s> it's easy to buy a bus pass <s/>
<s> all you have to do is get on the bus and ask for one <s/>
<s> it's that easy <s/>
<s> are you sure <s/>
<s> don't you believe me <s/>
<s> i do but i thought it would be more complicated than that <s/>
<s> there are other places where you can buy them <s/>
<s> i think i'll just buy the pass on the bus <s/>
<s> alright suit yourself <s/>
<s> and you're welcome <s/>
<s> hey were you able to find a new home to move into <s/>
<s> yes i did <s/>
<s> now i just have to move my things over to the new place <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> i'm glad you found a new place <s/>
<s> have you ever used a moving company before <s/>
<s> yes i have <s/>
<s> and the company is not bad <s/>
<s> i'm planning on moving soon <s/>
<s> i have never called a moving company before <s/>
<s> oh i see <s/>
<s> you have to call them as soon as possible <s/>
<s> why is that <s/>
<s> moving companies tend to get booked really fast especially during the summer <s/>
<s> that makes sense <s/>
<s> i guess i should call a moving company right now <s/>
<s> good luck <s/>
<s> i hope the move transitions smoothly <s/>
<s> thanks you for your advice <s/>
<s> see you later <s/>
<s> today is friday the thirteenth <s/>
<s> that's a bad day <s/>
<s> it's supposed to be unlucky <s/>
<s> you're supposed to stay home all day <s/>
<s> that's what i do <s/>
<s> my friend stayed in a hotel on friday the thirteenth <s/>
<s> that was a mistake <s/>
<s> he stayed on the thirteenth floor <s/>
<s> what happened <s/>
<s> someone stole his laptop <s/>
<s> he was asking for it <s/>
<s> he learned his lesson <s/>
<s> he's home today <s/>
<s> i'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus <s/>
<s> you should <s/>
<s> it takes away the stress of studying <s/>
<s> what sport do you play <s/>
<s> i actually play on our university's baseball team <s/>
<s> that's cool <s/>
<s> you must be really good <s/>
<s> yeah i have a baseball scholarship <s/>
<s> no wonder you're in such great shape <s/>
<s> you'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club <s/>
<s> i'm thinking of joining the tennis club <s/>
<s> i wouldn't if i were you <s/>
<s> the members don't even play tennis <s/>
<s> what do they do then <s/>
<s> they just talk about tennis <s/>
<s> they never even touched a racket though <s/>
<s> excuse me <s/>
<s> may i ask you a question <s/>
<s> what do you need to know <s/>
<s> do you know where i can purchase a bus pass <s/>
<s> there are several places where you can purchase them <s/>
<s> could you please tell me where <s/>
<s> there is one on norwalk one in long beach and one in santa clarita <s/>
<s> do you know how to get to the one located on norwalk <s/>
<s> here is a list of directions you can have <s/>
<s> can i keep it <s/>
<s> you can keep it <s/>
<s> thank you very much <s/>
<s> this is very helpful <s/>
<s> no problem <s/>
<s> i'm glad i could help <s/>
<s> lunch was delicious <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> what kind of soup was that <s/>
<s> it was tomato soup <s/>
<s> that tasted so good <s/>
<s> i put lemon and butter in it <s/>
<s> the sandwich was good too <s/>
<s> everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches <s/>
<s> especially on toast <s/>
<s> and the pickles were great too <s/>
<s> tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch <s/>
<s> i can't wait <s/>
<s> why do you seem so tired today <s/>
<s> i stayed up all night watching that new anime <s/>
<s> you stayed up to watch it again <s/>
<s> i just had to find out what happened next <s/>
<s> i don't think it's good to watch so many cartoons <s/>
<s> anime series are not cartoons <s/>
<s> of course they are <s/>
<s> they're drawn and colored <s/>
<s> anime is not for children <s/>
<s> the stories are more intense <s/>
<s> i think you're just telling yourself that <s/>
<s> cartoons don't have storylines like anime series do <s/>
<s> either way it's just a silly television show <s/>
<s> you really don't understand the life of a fan <s/>
<s> i have an extra ticket to the beyonce concert on friday <s/>
<s> that's nice <s/>
<s> i was wondering if you want to come with me <s/>
<s> i really like beyonce but i'm busy on friday <s/>
<s> oh i understand <s/>
<s> maybe we could go out some other time <s/>
<s> that's so sweet of you but i don't think so <s/>
<s> you're not really my type <s/>
<s> how do you know if you won't give me a chance <s/>
<s> well your insistence makes you seem a little desperate <s/>
<s> i'm not desperate <s/>
<s> i've just liked you for a long time <s/>
<s> again that's sweet but i'm not interested <s/>
<s> i need to report a robbery <s/>
<s> who was robbed <s/>
<s> i was robbed <s/>
<s> i'm so sorry <s/>
<s> when did this happen <s/>
<s> it happened 10 minutes ago <s/>
<s> where were you robbed <s/>
<s> right outside the bank <s/>
<s> i had just taken money from the atm <s/>
<s> can you describe the person who robbed you <s/>
<s> he was wearing dark sunglasses and a yankees baseball cap <s/>
<s> how much money did he take from you <s/>
<s> he took everything i had in my wallet <s/>
<s> you're going to have to fill out a police report <s/>
<s> welcome to the silver wok <s/>
<s> how can i help you <s/>
<s> hello i was hoping you have a table <s/>
<s> we should be okay <s/>
<s> how many guests <s/>

<s> i'm mr johnson <s/>
<s> i would appreciate it <s/>
<s> okay mr johnson <s/>
<s> i will have a table soon <s/>
<s> oh that's wonderful <s/>
<s> it's near the back <s/>
<s> is that okay <s/>
<s> yes i suppose it is <s/>
<s> i was hoping for window seating though <s/>
<s> i can accommodate you but it will take a little more time sir <s/>
<s> that's okay <s/>
<s> we'll wait <s/>
<s> you have pretty eyes <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> so do you <s/>
<s> i wish my eyes were blue <s/>
<s> what's the matter with green eyes <s/>
<s> nothing except my favorite color is blue <s/>
<s> maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes <s/>
<s> but what if i'm a fish in my next life <s/>
<s> i think some fish have blue eyes <s/>
<s> i hope i don't come back as a fish <s/>
<s> i hope i come back as a cat <s/>
<s> cats have beautiful eyes <s/>
<s> i would love to have blue cat-eyes <s/>
<s> let's book a trip to puerto rico <s/>
<s> there are so many online services that let us book from our computer right here at home <s/>
<s> how will we know we're getting a good deal though <s/>
<s> if we use a site like expedia or priceline we can find something within our budget <s/>
<s> can we book both flights and hotels online <s/>
<s> yes and we can even rent a car as part of our package <s/>
<s> i just logged onto those websites so now what <s/>
<s> just put the dates you want to travel where you're traveling from and where you want to go <s/>
<s> wow there are even reviews from people who stayed at the hotels <s/>
<s> you can even see pictures of what the hotel rooms look like <s/>
<s> we don't get paper tickets though <s/>
<s> we can print out all the information after we book it online if you want <s/>
<s> did you book the hotel for the trip <s/>
<s> yes and it comes with something extra <s/>
<s> what would that be exactly <s/>
<s> continental breakfast every morning <s/>
<s> do you think they serve pancakes <s/>
<s> oh with syrup and fresh fruit <s/>
<s> you can't forget the whipped cream <s/>
<s> and freshly brewed coffee <s/>
<s> i can't wait to see it all <s/>
<s> i think i'm more excited for breakfast than the trip <s/>
<s> well breakfast is the most important meal of the day <s/>
<s> that's very true <s/>
<s> i'm checking in <s/>
<s> what name is the reservation under <s/>
<s> it is under my name michael roberts <s/>
<s> can i see your identification please <s/>
<s> here is my driver's license <s/>
<s> i have you staying for two nights <s/>
<s> is that correct <s/>
<s> that's correct <s/>
<s> i need a credit card for any incidentals <s/>
<s> i don't plan on using the phone or the mini-bar <s/>
<s> i still need a credit card though <s/>
<s> can i pay cash <s/>
<s> you will have to pay a $200 cash deposit if you don't want to leave a credit card <s/>
<s> what classes should i take to transfer <s/>
<s> you need a little bit of everything <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> you need to take at least one class in every subject <s/>
<s> do i need to take a math class <s/>
<s> even if your major is portuguese you have to take a math class <s/>
<s> that's so stupid <s/>
<s> it's just to make you more knowledgeable <s/>
<s> but i don't even need it <s/>
<s> it's been like this for ages <s/>
<s> well the policy should be changed <s/>
<s> so in the meantime you should register for a math class <s/>
<s> so what did you think about the car <s/>
<s> it was a good test drive but i need to think it over <s/>
<s> do you have any questions or concerns <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but i don't think i am going to purchase this car <s/>
<s> if i may ask what didn't you like about the car <s/>
<s> i don't see myself driving this car <s/>
<s> is it the price <s/>
<s> let me talk to my manager; we might lower the price <s/>
<s> it's not the price <s/>
<s> i just don't think it's the right fit for me <s/>
<s> would you like to see another car at the dealership <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but i didn't see any other car i liked <s/>
<s> well thanks for considering our dealership <s/>
<s> if i change my mind i will let you know <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> do you have a girlfriend <s/>
<s> no i don't <s/>
<s> i don't have a girlfriend either <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> maybe i'm not rich enough <s/>
<s> girls like guys with money <s/>
<s> they sure do <s/>
<s> they like guys with new cars <s/>
<s> i don't have money or a new car <s/>
<s> me neither <s/>
<s> but girls like guys who are funny <s/>
<s> maybe we should learn some good jokes <s/>
<s> we had a problem at school <s/>
<s> what was the problem <s/>
<s> someone cut the tires <s/>
<s> what tires <s/>
<s> the tires on the cars <s/>
<s> where were the cars <s/>
<s> they were in the student parking lot <s/>
<s> how many tires were cut <s/>
<s> one or two tires were cut on each car <s/>
<s> how many cars <s/>
<s> eleven cars <s/>
<s> that's terrible <s/>
<s> i hope they catch the person <s/>
<s> i found an apartment <s/>
<s> that's great to hear <s/>
<s> i congratulate you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i'm so glad i finally found one <s/>
<s> how did you find it <s/>
<s> on the computer <s/>
<s> how did you know to look there <s/>
<s> a friend told me to look online <s/>
<s> where is the apartment <s/>
<s> in pasadena <s/>
<s> that's a nice town <s/>
<s> how big is the apartment <s/>
<s> it's big enough for me <s/>
<s> you should meet with a rental agent <s/>
<s> to get a professional opinion <s/>
<s> good idea <s/>
<s> know of any <s/>
<s> you could talk to mine <s/>
<s> here's his business card <s/>
<s> the house burned down <s/>
<s> what happened <s/>
<s> the man fell asleep <s/>
<s> was he smoking <s/>
<s> yes he was smoking a cigarette <s/>
<s> did he die <s/>
<s> yes he did <s/>
<s> his cat died too <s/>
<s> that's too bad <s/>
<s> what about his smoke alarm <s/>
<s> the battery was dead <s/>
<s> a good battery would have saved his life <s/>
<s> he had cigarettes but no battery <s/>
<s> it happens all the time <s/>
<s> do you want to go fishing <s/>
<s> thatâ’s a good idea <s/>
<s> where do you want to go <s/>
<s> we can go to the river <s/>
<s> or we can go to the lake <s/>
<s> or we can go to the ocean <s/>
<s> letâ’s go to the lake <s/>
<s> the lake is only 10 miles away <s/>
<s> we can be there in 20 minutes <s/>
<s> iâ’ll get our fishing rods <s/>
<s> iâ’ll get the bait <s/>
<s> weâ’ll have fresh fish for dinner <s/>
<s> i cut myself pretty badly with a knife <s/>
<s> i think i need stitches <s/>
<s> come inside so the triage nurse can stop the bleeding <s/>
<s> i was just preparing dinner and my hand slipped <s/>
<s> this cut does need stitches but i stopped the bleeding for now <s/>
<s> will you give me stitches right now <s/>
<s> no since the bleeding has stopped you have to wait in the emergency room waiting area <s/>
<s> what do i do while waiting <s/>
<s> fill out these registration forms <s/>
<s> when will i get my hand stitched up <s/>
<s> here in the er we take care of people based on how bad their injury is <s/>
<s> i was here before many of these other people <s/>
<s> some of them are in worse shape than you <s/>
<s> gravity is very important <s/>
<s> what is gravity <s/>
<s> it's the force that pulls everything down <s/>
<s> i don't understand <s/>
<s> if you pour water into a glass the water goes down into the glass <s/>
<s> of course it does <s/>
<s> without gravity the water would go up <s/>
<s> you're joking <s/>
<s> without gravity you would go up <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> you would float into the sky like a balloon <s/>
<s> that would be fun <s/>
<s> i can't believe he won the election <s/>
<s> only 15 percent of the voters turned out <s/>
<s> that is a joke <s/>
<s> voting is so important but people don't bother <s/>
<s> many people think their vote doesn't matter <s/>
<s> the mayor won by only 2000 votes <s/>
<s> we're stuck with him for four more years <s/>
<s> voting is so easy <s/>
<s> you can even mail your ballot in <s/>
<s> all you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it <s/>
<s> how easy is that <s/>
<s> i guess people just don't care <s/>
<s> they'll care when they see their taxes go up <s/>
<s> what are you doing here <s/>
<s> i lost my job so here i am at the edd <s/>
<s> that's rough <s/>
<s> i lost my job three months ago <s/>
<s> i didn't know that <s/>
<s> maybe you can help me apply <s/>
<s> sure i can help <s/>
<s> you just need some basic information about your job history <s/>
<s> i have that information for the company i last worked for <s/>
<s> they ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months <s/>
<s> i can get that <s/>
<s> what else do they ask <s/>
<s> name residence addresses that kind of stuff and most importantly why you're not working <s/>
<s> you mean if i quit or was fired <s/>
<s> yes and be truthful <s/>
<s> they will call your former employers <s/>
<s> that helps a lot <s/>
<s> i'm a good card player <s/>
<s> why is that <s/>
<s> because i watch the other players <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> people will tell you if they have a good hand <s/>
<s> how do they do that <s/>
<s> for example a friend of mine licks his lips <s/>
<s> when he licks his lips you know he has a good hand <s/>
<s> i know he has a good hand so i don't bet <s/>
<s> he never wins your money <s/>
<s> nope and it drives him crazy <s/>
<s> he knows you can't read his mind <s/>
<s> maybe he thinks you're cheating <s/>
<s> i used to work in a deli <s/>
<s> how did you like it <s/>
<s> i loved it <s/>
<s> did you get free food <s/>
<s> i ate free cheese and meat every day <s/>
<s> that sounds like a great job <s/>
<s> whatever a customer ordered i sliced off a little more for me <s/>
<s> did you get fat <s/>
<s> no but i did put on a few pounds <s/>
<s> that sounds like a dream job <s/>
<s> it was until one day my manager caught me <s/>
<s> no more free cheese for you huh <s/>
<s> you know my birthday is coming up in three weeks <s/>
<s> so you are getting older <s/>
<s> indeed i am and that's why i'm celebrating with a party <s/>
<s> i love parties <s/>
<s> when is it going to be <s/>
<s> the party is going to be the saturday before my birthday <s/>
<s> where is the party going to be held <s/>
<s> it's going to be at the arcade on main street <s/>
<s> will you come <s/>
<s> of course i will be there <s/>
<s> here's an invitation with all of the details <s/>
<s> what time does the party start <s/>
<s> it starts at 1 pm <s/>
<s> i will be there <s/>
<s> the first thing you want to do is fasten your seat belt <s/>
<s> what's next <s/>
<s> check your mirrors and make sure you can see behind you <s/>
<s> should i put it in reverse now <s/>
<s> yes ease off the brake slowly <s/>
<s> okay i need to turn to leave the parking lot <s/>
<s> make sure there are no pedestrians walking behind you <s/>
<s> okay do i turn the steering wheel to the left <s/>
<s> yes make sure you are paying attention to the cars <s/>
<s> do i put it in drive now <s/>
<s> yes but remember have your foot on the brake and then ease it off <s/>
<s> wow this seems easy <s/>
<s> let's go out on the street <s/>
<s> i got my roommate today <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> when do you move in <s/>
<s> i move in next week <s/>
<s> is there anything you have to take <s/>
<s> yeah there are a few things <s/>
<s> write down a list so we can go shopping <s/>
<s> here you go i'm all done <s/>
<s> this is a pretty long list <s/>
<s> there's a lot of stuff i need <s/>
<s> i don't think you need a disco ball <s/>
<s> of course i do <s/>
<s> it goes with the strobe light <s/>
<s> please write a more practical list <s/>
<s> i think this new place will work out great <s/>
<s> why do you say that dan <s/>
<s> it seems there's so much nearby <s/>
<s> like what baby <s/>
<s> didn't you see all the grocery stores <s/>
<s> i saw a couple <s/>
<s> there are lots of them and some specialty shops <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> like what <s/>
<s> i saw a produce stand and a butcher market next to each other <s/>
<s> where was that <s/>
<s> i'll take you later <s/>
<s> that sounds great <s/>
<s> i look forward to it <s/>
<s> i'm not sleeping here tonight <s/>
<s> what's the matter <s/>
<s> this is a nice room <s/>
<s> maybe the room is nice but not the bed <s/>
<s> what's wrong with the bed <s/>
<s> look at this sheet <s/>
<s> see those stains <s/>
<s> i sure do <s/>
<s> i'm not sleeping on that sheet <s/>
<s> well just call the front desk <s/>
<s> they'll give us new sheets <s/>
<s> i want sheets without stains on them <s/>
<s> from now on let's bring our own sheets <s/>
<s> that is a beautiful house <s/>
<s> i don't like it <s/>
<s> what's the matter with it <s/>
<s> it's on the corner <s/>
<s> that means it gets twice as much traffic <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> when you're inside you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection <s/>
<s> or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop <s/>
<s> or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house <s/>
<s> let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end <s/>
<s> that's perfect <s/>
<s> the less traffic the better <s/>
<s> i'm interested in signing up for your cable service <s/>
<s> alright please choose the package you'd like <s/>
<s> does this package get me all the movie channels <s/>
<s> i'm afraid not <s/>
<s> this is the basic package <s/>
<s> how much is it for the movie channels <s/>
<s> that package is an extra $20 a month <s/>
<s> that's going to cost me an arm and a leg <s/>
<s> you'll also get the premium sports channels <s/>
<s> well that does sound tempting <s/>
<s> if you sign up for our email updates i'll give you a discount <s/>
<s> alright i'll take the premium package <s/>
<s> you've made a wonderful choice <s/>
<s> tomorrow's election day but i don't know where i'm supposed to go vote <s/>
<s> you didn't get a card in the mail telling you where you polling place is <s/>
<s> i think i threw it away <s/>
<s> can't i just go with you <s/>
<s> everyone's polling place is different based on your address <s/>
<s> so how do i know where to go now <s/>
<s> you can check the board of elections website <s/>
<s> what if i don't have internet access <s/>
<s> there's also a phone number you can call <s/>
<s> where is your polling place <s/>
<s> my polling place is at the recreation center a block away from my house <s/>
<s> will my polling place be close to where i live <s/>
<s> it should be within walking distance <s/>
<s> the best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified ms anderson <s/>
<s> why is that mr williams <s/>
<s> by pre-qualifying you know beforehand which house you can buy <s/>
<s> i thought i would look at houses first <s/>
<s> that's okay too but you may be wasting your time <s/>
<s> how so mr williams <s/>
<s> you may find a house you really like but can't afford it <s/>
<s> well that's when i'll negotiate with the seller <s/>
<s> yes that's true but by pre-qualifying you'll save time and effort <s/>
<s> how is that <s/>
<s> you will be able to select a home you know you can afford <s/>
<s> then we'll try it your way <s/>
<s> i am so excited <s/>
<s> i've got my first job interview <s/>
<s> interview for what <s/>
<s> it's an engineering internship for the city of la <s/>
<s> wow that's impressive <s/>
<s> i'm preparing for the interview by practicing with my sister <s/>
<s> what exactly are you doing <s/>
<s> we're doing mock interviews <s/>
<s> is that helpful <s/>
<s> it sure is <s/>
<s> she recorded our first interview and pointed out things i should avoid <s/>
<s> what are some of the things she saw <s/>
<s> she said that i saidyou know too much and that i looked nervous <s/>
<s> that should help <s/>
<s> i feel so confident now <s/>
<s> well good luck my friend <s/>
<s> i'm new to the apartments <s/>
<s> i have a question <s/>
<s> hello and welcome <s/>
<s> what do you need to know <s/>
<s> is there anything about parking my car that i need to know <s/>
<s> you have an assigned parking spot behind the building <s/>
<s> are there other parking spots available <s/>
<s> we have several unassigned spots for visitors <s/>
<s> where are those visitor parking spots located <s/>

<s> how do you prepare the potatoes <s/>
<s> i wash them and then steam them for 15 minutes <s/>

<s> i woke up with the worse stomachache <s/>
<s> did you try going to the bathroom <s/>

<s> it's a form you mail in saying who you want to vote for <s/>
<s> does it count like a regular ballot <s/>
<s> it's just as if you were voting in person <s/>
<s> i'd better ask for one then <s/>
<s> you should do it quickly since it has to be in a week before election day <s/>

<s> we work together <s/>
<s> they say he has started fifteen big fires <s/>
<s> he's been in jail three times already <s/>
<s> why did they ever let him out <s/>
<s> it's the law <s/>
<s> they can't keep him in jail forever <s/>
<s> everyone knows he's a firebug <s/>
<s> he loves to start fires <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> sometimes the law doesn't make sense <s/>
<s> but his latest fire killed someone <s/>
<s> this time they have charged him with murder <s/>
<s> so maybe he'll go to jail forever <s/>
<s> i sure hope so <s/>
<s> someone should set him on fire <s/>
<s> that would teach him a good lesson <s/>
<s> i need some pants <s/>
<s> i thought you just bought a pair <s/>
<s> what's wrong with them so soon <s/>
<s> the pants are fine but the pocket has a huge hole in it <s/>
<s> you shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket <s/>
<s> but that's what pockets are for <s/>
<s> you should carry them in a purse <s/>
<s> i'm a man and men don't carry purses <s/>
<s> well you should buy pants with stronger pockets <s/>
<s> i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets <s/>
<s> try a google search online <s/>
<s> excuse me sir <s/>
<s> yes is there a problem <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to be the one to tell you but you can't park here <s/>
<s> you mean right here where i just parked <s/>
<s> yes unfortunately you cannot <s/>
<s> oh i was not aware that you couldn't park here <s/>
<s> that's alright <s/>
<s> it's a common mistake new residents often make <s/>
<s> thank you for informing me <s/>
<s> not a problem <s/>
<s> i wouldn't want you to get a parking ticket <s/>
<s> that's so considerate of you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>
<s> just keep it in mind for the next time <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> i won't forget <s/>
<s> do you know what forms i need to file an unemployment claim <s/>
<s> you can go to an edd office or fill out a form on their website to open a claim <s/>
<s> is it really that simple <s/>
<s> it sure is <s/>
<s> it is easier to do online <s/>
<s> why would i want to do it online <s/>
<s> it's faster and you can do it from home or wherever you have internet access <s/>
<s> do you know the website <s/>
<s> yes it's eddcagov <s/>
<s> it's easy to use <s/>
<s> then what do i do <s/>
<s> you will have to find a link that says apply here and click on it <s/>
<s> is that all there is to it <s/>
<s> that's it <s/>
<s> you're good to go <s/>
<s> i have an early meeting so can i get a wake-up call <s/>

<s> can i request a second wake-up call <s/>
<s> what time should we schedule the second wake-up call <s/>
<s> call me again at 6 <s/>
<s> so we have one wake-up call at six and a second one fifteen minutes later <s/>
<s> i would like to reserve the hunger games <s/>
<s> everyone wants to reserve that book these days <s/>
<s> it's really popular because the movie just came out <s/>
<s> you have to pay $1 to reserve the book <s/>
<s> that's ridiculous <s/>
<s> like you said it's popular <s/>
<s> i have to think about it then <s/>
<s> i personally think $1 is nothing <s/>
<s> it's cheaper than buying the book <s/>
<s> how much is the book <s/>
<s> on the back it says it's $15 <s/>
<s> it depends on the bookstore you go to though <s/>
<s> fine i'll give you a $1 <s/>
<s> you won't regret it <s/>
<s> the book is really good <s/>
<s> i need new clothes <s/>
<s> what kinds of new clothes <s/>
<s> i want something stylish <s/>
<s> what do you want new clothes for <s/>
<s> well school starts again in a week <s/>
<s> looking good costs money though <s/>
<s> i know what you mean <s/>
<s> the stuff you're looking for is expensive <s/>
<s> yeah i don't have much money <s/>

<s> okay so what's next <s/>
<s> i have a standard contract we use <s/>
<s> you can look it over if you like <s/>

<s> i still have the final say on the deal though right <s/>
<s> of course you do mr rogers <s/>
<s> i just wanted to be clear on that <s/>
<s> why are you taking this class <s/>

<s> yeah i hate public speaking <s/>
<s> i get so nervous <s/>
<s> i just want this class to be over with <s/>
<s> it's going to be a long semester <s/>
<s> maybe after this class we'll love public speaking <s/>
<s> i doubt it <s/>
<s> i don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer <s/>
<s> i guess it's to make us better speakers <s/>
<s> it'll all be worth it when we transfer <s/>
<s> what time does your plane leave <s/>
<s> it leaves at 12 <s/>
<s> when do you have to be at the airport <s/>
<s> i have to be there two hours early <s/>
<s> so we have to be at the airport at 10 <s/>
<s> that means we have to leave the house at 9 <s/>
<s> well it's an hour to get there if there are no traffic problems <s/>
<s> so maybe we better leave at 8 <s/>
<s> yes it's better to get there too early than too late <s/>

<s> that's not right <s/>
<s> when i started to cross the street the white walk sign was blinking <s/>
<s> you need to walk faster <s/>
<s> what did the doctor say <s/>
<s> he thinks i have too much stress <s/>
<s> stress causes your stomachaches <s/>
<s> stress causes different problems with different people <s/>
<s> so what did he tell you to do <s/>
<s> he said i need to think positive <s/>
<s> he didn't give you any medication <s/>
<s> i hate medication <s/>
<s> it makes me feel different <s/>

<s> he was tall wearing sunglasses and a yankees baseball cap <s/>
<s> did he have any weapons <s/>

<s> plus installation <s/>
<s> no my hard drive is easy to remove and replace <s/>
<s> yes it's just a couple of screws <s/>

<s> why was that <s/>
<s> i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it <s/>
<s> what's the matter with that <s/>
<s> her mom is a great cook <s/>
<s> so a little salt and pepper never hurt anything <s/>
<s> it hurt her feelings <s/>
<s> i apologized to her but i could tell she was still upset <s/>
<s> maybe you shouldn't eat there again <s/>
<s> i'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two <s/>
<s> it's your girlfriend's fault <s/>

<s> can i borrow $5 <s/>
<s> why do you need it <s/>
<s> i want to buy lunch <s/>
<s> where's your money <s/>
<s> it's not in my wallet <s/>

<s> i think it was the 10th edition <s/>
<s> oh no wonder he or she is selling it for only $30 <s/>

<s> i think i'll take physics and french <s/>
<s> i'm glad you know what to take <s/>

<s> yes he stole a plane in canada and flew into the us <s/>
<s> did they catch him <s/>
<s> after two us fighter jets followed him for an hour he landed on a highway <s/>
<s> did he crash <s/>
<s> no he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant <s/>
<s> did the cops find out why he flew into the us <s/>
<s> his life sucked <s/>
<s> he was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down <s/>
<s> the police need our help finding a robber <s/>
<s> how do you know <s/>
<s> the tv news is reporting a bank robbery <s/>
<s> do they know what the robber looks like <s/>
<s> yes he's 6 feet tall 200 pounds black hair and about 30 years old <s/>
<s> what race is he <s/>
<s> they didn't say <s/>
<s> the tv news doesn't tell us the race anymore <s/>
<s> of course not <s/>
<s> that would be racist <s/>
<s> but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race <s/>
<s> don't ask me <s/>
<s> then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female because that is sexist <s/>
<s> i like this magazine <s/>
<s> i read it once and i subscribed <s/>

<s> he's visiting other cities to get ideas <s/>

<s> how far away is old town from the apartment's location <s/>
<s> ten minutes away on car <s/>

<s> just be prepared the next time <s/>
<s> hello is this the smith residence <s/>
<s> hello how can i help you today <s/>
<s> i am very upset with the quality of your service <s/>
<s> i'm sorry what seems to be the problem <s/>
<s> my internet service did not work for three days <s/>
<s> my records say a technician visited your area yesterday <s/>
<s> yes he installed a new modem <s/>
<s> did it solve the problem <s/>
<s> yes but i was overcharged for internet service <s/>
<s> sorry about that <s/>
<s> i'll give you credit for the three days <s/>
<s> i was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area <s/>
<s> i see it here; we charged you $5 extra a month <s/>
<s> kindly return my money please <s/>
<s> are there any good french restaurants around here <s/>
<s> there are quite a few <s/>
<s> i have some menus you can look at <s/>
<s> which one do you recommend <s/>
<s> it's my wife's birthday <s/>
<s> the french quarter is very romantic <s/>
<s> is it very expensive <s/>
<s> it is about $50 a person not including alcohol or tip <s/>
<s> do i need a reservation <s/>
<s> yes but i would be happy to make that reservation for you <s/>
<s> get us a table for two at 8 <s/>
<s> will you also need transportation to the restaurant <s/>
<s> can you get a limo to pick us up <s/>
<s> i can do that for $30 <s/>
<s> i'm so frustrated <s/>
<s> i can't find any books on my research topic at my library <s/>
<s> why don't you try a different library <s/>
<s> i don't want to waste gas money <s/>
<s> but you might find your book <s/>
<s> what library do you suggest <s/>
<s> i suggest the one near my house <s/>
<s> that is way too far for me <s/>
<s> they have a lot of books <s/>
<s> that library has never disappointed me <s/>
<s> i have an idea <s/>
<s> why don't you borrow them for me <s/>
<s> i don't know about that <s/>
<s> what if you lose the books <s/>
<s> i swear on my life <s/>
<s> wow you're so serious <s/>
<s> i have a really bad headache <s/>
<s> what do you recommend <s/>
<s> you can purchase some over-the-counter pain relievers in aisle 6 <s/>
<s> do i need a prescription for those <s/>
<s> you just pick whichever brand your prefer and pay for it at the register <s/>
<s> there are so many choices <s/>
<s> if you read the labels you can pick the one that is best for you <s/>
<s> is there a difference between the name brand pills and the store brand pills <s/>
<s> usually there isn't <s/>
<s> just compare the labels and look for active ingredients <s/>
<s> the store brand is less expensive <s/>
<s> usually it is just as effective <s/>
<s> i sure hope so because i want to save money and not have a headache <s/>
<s> i think you can achieve both things <s/>
<s> why don't you ever answer your phone <s/>
<s> i'm usually busy <s/>
<s> what's up <s/>
<s> i wanted to see if you were down to kick it <s/>
<s> where do you want to go <s/>
<s> i don't have that much money <s/>
<s> let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week <s/>
<s> okay but i only have enough for three beers <s/>
<s> it's fine <s/>
<s> i'll pay for the rest but you owe me <s/>
<s> screw that i paid for you last time <s/>
<s> you owe me <s/>
<s> well then we can call it even <s/>
<s> i guess so <s/>
<s> where should we meet <s/>
<s> how about at the train station by the bar <s/>
<s> sounds good <s/>
<s> i'll see you in an hour <s/>
<s> see you then laters <s/>
<s> remember to put air in your tires <s/>
<s> how often do i have to do that <s/>
<s> once every two months <s/>
<s> that's a lot <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> that's six times a year <s/>
<s> yes and it takes about five minutes each time <s/>
<s> check your tires or you'll get a flat <s/>
<s> that's not good <s/>
<s> no it isn't <s/>
<s> a flat costs you time and money <s/>
<s> and i don't have either <s/>
<s> do you smell that <s/>
<s> i can't stand cigarette smoke <s/>
<s> it smells so bad <s/>
<s> one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk <s/>
<s> smokers think they are so cool <s/>
<s> they are so weak <s/>
<s> a little cigarette controls them <s/>
<s> they look so stupid taking a puff <s/>
<s> and then they blow smoke out of their mouth <s/>
<s> they think it's cool <s/>
<s> cigarettes stink <s/>
<s> what are you doing <s/>
<s> i'm filling out my college application <s/>

<s> also should i put all of my extracurriculars <s/>
<s> put the ones that you were heavily involved in <s/>
<s> next question should i put anything in the additional information section <s/>
<s> if you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before then yes <s/>
<s> can i say i got an a when i really just got a b <s/>
<s> of course not <s/>
<s> they will ask for your transcript <s/>
<s> oh i didn't know that <s/>
<s> are you telling me it's not weird dating katy after being friends with her for so long <s/>
<s> it's a little strange since i've known her for so long <s/>
<s> you also know everyone she dated <s/>
<s> i've given her advice on guys she's dated <s/>
<s> didn't she date your best friend once <s/>
<s> yeah but he stopped being my best friend after i started dating katy <s/>
<s> why is that <s/>
<s> he thought i had always been after her <s/>
<s> had you always been after her <s/>
<s> honestly no <s/>
<s> i really only liked her as a friend <s/>
<s> when did that change <s/>
<s> when i came back from finishing college <s/>
<s> did you get the invitation to my party <s/>

<s> i think this house will fill all you needs mr jones <s/>
<s> well i don't particularly like the neighborhood <s/>
<s> i understand your concern mr jones but let's take a look inside <s/>
<s> okay but i'm really concerned about the neighborhood <s/>
<s> that's okay mr jones <s/>
<s> we're not married to this home <s/>
<s> i guess we can look inside since we're here <s/>
<s> let's go inside <s/>
<s> it's a beautiful home <s/>
<s> i don't like it already <s/>
<s> the porch is too small <s/>
<s> i have a big family <s/>
<s> all right mr jones <s/>
<s> this may not be the right house for you <s/>
<s> that's what i've been trying to tell you <s/>
<s> that's okay <s/>
<s> i've got more homes to show you <s/>
<s> that's good to hear <s/>
<s> i'm so thirsty <s/>
<s> you might want to buy something refreshing <s/>

<s> it's already evening <s/>
<s> what have you been doing <s/>
<s> i've been reading a very interesting book <s/>
<s> that is exactly why i don't like reading <s/>
<s> why don't you like reading <s/>
<s> you could have watched three movies by now <s/>
<s> books are always much better than movies <s/>
<s> the hunger games movies are pretty good <s/>
<s> they leave out a lot of the best details <s/>
<s> it's probably because the details were not that important <s/>
<s> details are what makes life interesting <s/>
<s> i hate flying <s/>
<s> a long time ago flying used to be okay <s/>
<s> now it's like riding a bus <s/>
<s> you're jammed in with people all around you <s/>
<s> half of them are coughing and the other half are sneezing <s/>
<s> you don't have any elbow room or knee room <s/>
<s> people are always getting up to use the bathroom <s/>
<s> kids are crying or climbing over you <s/>
<s> it's a flying zoo <s/>
<s> i wish i could afford first class seats <s/>
<s> doesn't everybody <s/>
<s> we should start fixing up the interior of the house angela <s/>
<s> why is that jonathan <s/>
<s> don't we have time <s/>
<s> yes we do but the sooner the better <s/>
<s> i guess so <s/>
<s> where do we start <s/>
<s> i think the kitchen would be best <s/>
<s> why would the kitchen be best <s/>
<s> i just think it's a very important room <s/>
<s> well yes <s/>
<s> i guess we spend a lot of time there <s/>
<s> everyone does <s/>
<s> okay what should we do first <s/>
<s> how about the cabinets <s/>
<s> they're not too expensive and it will look good <s/>
<s> sounds good to me <s/>
<s> i'll start looking into it tomorrow <s/>
<s> good afternoon <s/>
<s> i want to get a us passport <s/>
<s> is this your first passport <s/>
<s> it is my first us passport <s/>
<s> did you fill out the application form <s/>
<s> i downloaded the form at home and have it here <s/>
<s> did you bring proof of us citizenship <s/>
<s> what kind of proof do i need <s/>
<s> a birth certificate if you were born in the us or naturalization papers <s/>
<s> i'm a new citizen so i have naturalization papers <s/>
<s> this is good because it also serves as your identification <s/>
<s> what else do i need to provide <s/>
<s> i just need $165 and two photographs <s/>
<s> let's go to the beach <s/>
<s> that's a great idea <s/>
<s> we haven't been in a while <s/>
<s> we haven't been in a month <s/>
<s> the last time we went you almost drowned <s/>
<s> no i didn't <s/>
<s> then why did the lifeguard dive into the water <s/>
<s> i think he wanted to cool off <s/>
<s> he swam right up to you <s/>
<s> and then he turned right around <s/>
<s> maybe you're right <s/>
<s> maybe we should get going <s/>
<s> i need a job <s/>
<s> what was your last job <s/>
<s> i was a painter <s/>

<s> i got laid off because there was no work <s/>
<s> what else can you do <s/>
<s> i'm a handyman <s/>
<s> can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> then i have a job for you in my kitchen <s/>
<s> it will cost you only $20 plus parts <s/>
<s> that sounds like a fair price <s/>
<s> this hot bread is delicious <s/>
<s> i like this restaurant because they give you free bread <s/>
<s> well i think we are paying for it <s/>
<s> look at the bill when we get it <s/>
<s> there's no charge for the bread <s/>
<s> it is delicious especially with butter <s/>
<s> i think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread <s/>
<s> they probably wouldn't like that <s/>
<s> i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full <s/>
<s> then stop eating the bread <s/>
<s> okay just one more piece <s/>
<s> pass the butter please <s/>
<s> if i owned a restaurant i would never serve hot bread before the main course <s/>
<s> that's terrible <s/>
<s> i would never go to your restaurant <s/>
<s> tiger is the greatest golfer in the world <s/>
<s> you can say that again <s/>
<s> but iâ’m worried about tiger <s/>
<s> why is that <s/>
<s> because he likes to scuba dive <s/>
<s> whatâ’s wrong with that <s/>
<s> it can be dangerous <s/>
<s> you mean he could drown <s/>
<s> he shouldnâ’t scuba dive until he retires <s/>
<s> but he dives to relax <s/>
<s> he might relax but it makes me nervous <s/>
<s> if his wife doesnâ’t mind you shouldnâ’t mind <s/>

<s> he gave me an f because i double spaced my essay <s/>
<s> but every professor wants essays double spaced <s/>
<s> he's crazy <s/>
<s> professor hernandez is weird <s/>
<s> he wants essays triple spaced <s/>
<s> that's just a waste of paper <s/>
<s> why does he like triple spacing <s/>
<s> he says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections because we're stupid <s/>
<s> we should start a petition and get him fired <s/>

<s> you should be happy not worried <s/>
<s> i am happy but marriage is a lot of responsibility <s/>
<s> yes you have to take care of your wife <s/>
<s> and i have to take care of our children <s/>
<s> are you going to start a family <s/>
<s> we want to have a little boy and a little girl <s/>
<s> that sounds wonderful <s/>
<s> except we can't afford it <s/>
<s> no wonder you're worried <s/>
<s> i don't get art <s/>
<s> or artists <s/>
<s> they're in a different world <s/>
<s> i saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils <s/>
<s> the artist said the jar was both full and empty <s/>
<s> but it was full of pencils <s/>
<s> how could he say it was empty <s/>
<s> artists see things differently <s/>
<s> did you ever see anything that picasso painted <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> he's world famous <s/>
<s> did he ever take art lessons <s/>
<s> i can't believe it <s/>
<s> i drew paintings like that in third grade <s/>
<s> where are they <s/>
<s> maybe they are worth millions <s/>
<s> what's the point <s/>
<s> the point of what <s/>
<s> of living <s/>
<s> who knows <s/>
<s> you live and then you die <s/>
<s> we must be here for some reason <s/>
<s> maybe we're here to have fun <s/>
<s> then why aren't i having fun <s/>
<s> because you're thinking too much <s/>
<s> so i should stop thinking <s/>
<s> stop thinking about what the point is <s/>
<s> i'll start thinking about having some fun <s/>
<s> just be patient <s/>
<s> fun doesn't come along every five minutes <s/>
<s> beer is a powerful drug <s/>
<s> so are cigarettes <s/>
<s> which would you prefer <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> when you die and go to heaven they will offer you beer or cigarettes <s/>
<s> i could pick only one or the other <s/>
<s> nothing's perfect not even in heaven <s/>
<s> boy that's a tough one <s/>
<s> what's so tough about it <s/>
<s> of course i would pick cigarettes <s/>
<s> but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer <s/>
<s> well you can't have everything <s/>
<s> i don't think i want to go to your heaven <s/>
<s> my pants have a hole in the front pocket <s/>
<s> you shouldn't carry pens in your pocket <s/>
<s> yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe <s/>
<s> lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife <s/>
<s> who carries a sharp knife in their pocket <s/>
<s> criminals of course <s/>
<s> anyway i have to fix the hole <s/>
<s> you can sew it up or use an iron-on patch <s/>
<s> tell me about this patch <s/>
<s> the patch has glue <s/>
<s> the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on <s/>
<s> that sounds a lot easier than sewing <s/>
<s> but after about ten washings the glue washes off <s/>
<s> do you know any good jokes <s/>
<s> i can't remember jokes <s/>
<s> neither can i <s/>
<s> they go in one ear and out the other <s/>
<s> who makes up all these jokes <s/>
<s> who knows <s/>
<s> but there must be a hundred new ones every day <s/>
<s> yes just in english alone <s/>
<s> i wonder if every language has jokes <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> people everywhere like good jokes <s/>
<s> what do you think people joke about the most <s/>
<s> i think most jokes are about women <s/>
<s> oh really <s/>
<s> i think most jokes are about men <s/>
<s> you're very lucky <s/>
<s> why do you say that <s/>
<s> you speak two languages <s/>
<s> well my english isn't perfect <s/>
<s> no one speaks perfect english <s/>
<s> maybe i will be the first <s/>
<s> i've been thinking about learning spanish <s/>
<s> spanish is easy <s/>
<s> i'll be happy to teach you <s/>
<s> how long will it take me to learn <s/>
<s> i think it will only take you a year or two <s/>
<s> how soon can we begin <s/>
<s> that means right now <s/>
<s> do you know what today is <s/>
<s> yes it's april 22 <s/>
<s> it's more than just a date <s/>
<s> is it your birthday or anniversary <s/>
<s> no it's earth day <s/>
<s> what's that <s/>
<s> it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet <s/>
<s> oh you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff <s/>
<s> we need to think green save water and stop using plastic bags <s/>
<s> how about if i take shorter showers <s/>
<s> that's a good idea because showers waste a lot of water <s/>
<s> from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower <s/>
<s> poetry sucks <s/>
<s> i don't know anyone who likes it <s/>
<s> some of it is okay i guess <s/>
<s> yes the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember <s/>
<s> like one two buckle my shoe <s/>
<s> but people still write poems <s/>
<s> no one makes any money at it <s/>
<s> shakespeare was a poet <s/>
<s> did he get rich from his poetry <s/>
<s> probably not <s/>
<s> poems are a little bit like songs <s/>
<s> yes but songs have music <s/>
<s> without music songs would suck too <s/>
<s> hey professor hill <s/>
<s> what is it <s/>
<s> i've been having trouble with derivatives <s/>
<s> that's not good <s/>
<s> there's a test on derivatives next week <s/>
<s> can i make an appointment with you for some help <s/>
<s> i'm a busy man <s/>
<s> you didn't even check your schedule yet <s/>
<s> i know i'm busy because many people already made appointments <s/>
<s> so i'm hopeless <s/>
<s> of course not <s/>
<s> there's the tutoring center <s/>
<s> but the tutors are not professors <s/>
<s> they're just students <s/>
<s> they might surprise you <s/>
<s> there's something wrong with my orange <s/>
<s> what's wrong <s/>
<s> it's not orange <s/>
<s> your orange isn't orange <s/>
<s> no it's dark pink <s/>
<s> are you sure <s/>
<s> i never heard of such a thing <s/>
<s> i just peeled it and i'm looking at it right now <s/>
<s> let me see <s/>
<s> yes you're right <s/>
<s> your orange is pink <s/>
<s> who ever heard of such a thing <s/>
<s> here's the little sticker that was on it <s/>
<s> it's called a pink navel <s/>
<s> what is this world coming to <s/>
<s> who knows <s/>
<s> maybe soon we'll have pink bananas <s/>
<s> did you see that puddle of water on the floor <s/>
<s> i called for a clean-up <s/>
<s> a puddle of water is very dangerous <s/>
<s> it isn't easy to see <s/>
<s> but it's real easy to slip on <s/>
<s> especially on these slick floors <s/>
<s> someone who slips could hurt their back <s/>
<s> they could even crack their head open <s/>
<s> we should stand here till the clean-up person gets here <s/>
<s> we can leave if we put an orange cone here <s/>
<s> yes but i don't know where the orange cones are <s/>
<s> it doesn't matter <s/>
<s> here he comes now with the mop <s/>
<s> can i try your coffee <s/>
<s> here you go <s/>
<s> hmm that's not bad <s/>
<s> there's nothing in it <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> i mean it's just coffee <s/>
<s> i figured that <s/>
<s> it's not too bitter for you <s/>
<s> it's a little bitter but it's okay <s/>
<s> there's no sugar or cream in it <s/>
<s> no it's a taste you have to get used to <s/>
<s> sort of like beer <s/>
<s> can you tell us what you saw <s/>
<s> i didn't see much <s/>
<s> i was afraid <s/>
<s> why were you afraid <s/>
<s> the man had his hand in his pocket like he had a gun <s/>
<s> did you actually see a gun <s/>
<s> no i didn't <s/>
<s> did you see the man take the woman's wallet <s/>
<s> i was inside the bank waiting on line <s/>
<s> could you come to the precinct and fill out a witness statement <s/>
<s> is it going to take very long <s/>
<s> no it won't and an officer will drive you home <s/>
<s> i guess i can go to the precinct then <s/>
<s> how many universities are you applying to <s/>
<s> i'm applying to 12 universities <s/>
<s> that's a lot <s/>
<s> i just want a lot of options <s/>
<s> but it costs a lot of money and time <s/>
<s> i get fee waivers <s/>
<s> but how about the time <s/>
<s> i mean applying is a lot of work <s/>
<s> college applications ask similar questions <s/>
<s> good for you <s/>
<s> i'm only applying to three universities <s/>
<s> which ones are you applying to <s/>
<s> csula uc irvine and yale <s/>
<s> i find it hard to believe that you can limit yourself to only three universities <s/>
<s> the apartment seems nice <s/>
<s> it sure does <s/>
<s> i just have a few questions to ask <s/>
<s> about what <s/>
<s> the apartment's location <s/>
<s> i'll try my best to answer them <s/>
<s> is the location in close proximity to the police department <s/>
<s> yes it is <s/>
<s> only fifteen minutes away <s/>
<s> what about the fire department <s/>
<s> not as close as the police department but still not far <s/>
<s> that's good to hear <s/>

<s> is this a new position <s/>
<s> yes we have created this new position recently <s/>

<s> the summer months are very busy here <s/>

<s> okay i have no more questions <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>

<s> what is your friend's favorite color <s/>
<s> she loves the color pink <s/>
<s> i can make her a bouquet with pink roses <s/>
<s> i don't want roses because that seems romantic not to mention expensive <s/>
<s> i can make the bouquet with carnations lilies and daisies instead <s/>
<s> that sounds friendlier and cheaper <s/>

<s> that would be a great surprise <s/>
<s> just fill out this card and include the delivery address <s/>

<s> you date so many girls that i get confused <s/>
<s> first off i don't date that many girls and secondly you're always confused <s/>

<s> i assumed you saw the tattoo <s/>

<s> it's a little more money but i think it's a great fit for you <s/>
<s> as long as i can afford it <s/>
<s> the porch is very large <s/>
<s> i think your family will like it <s/>
<s> that's a good place to start <s/>
<s> this is the living area <s/>
<s> as you can see it's quite spacious <s/>
<s> and this is the master bedroom <s/>
<s> sorry it's a beautiful home but it just doesn't feel right <s/>
<s> what's wrong mr jones <s/>
<s> it's the lighting and it just doesn't feel right sorry <s/>
<s> you're driving too fast <s/>
<s> i'm in a hurry <s/>
<s> don't ever be in a hurry <s/>
<s> it's not my fault <s/>
<s> you didn't wake me up <s/>
<s> that's not my fault <s/>
<s> you didn't tell me to wake you up <s/>
<s> well i meant to <s/>
<s> don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving <s/>
<s> because you'll have an accident <s/>
<s> most accidents are because people are in a hurry <s/>
<s> how do you know that <s/>
<s> i read a lot <s/>
<s> i thought drunks caused most accidents <s/>
<s> is this a clean restaurant <s/>
<s> well the tables and chairs look okay <s/>
<s> okay let's sit down <s/>
<s> check out the silverware <s/>
<s> it passes inspection <s/>
<s> here comes the waiter <s/>
<s> see if his hands and nails are clean <s/>
<s> well the waiter looked clean so i guess it's okay to eat here <s/>
<s> you're forgetting about the bathroom <s/>
<s> i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean <s/>
<s> you're not going to examine it before we order dinner <s/>
<s> no i'd rather not find out that it's dirty because i'm pretty hungry right now <s/>
<s> let's forget about germs and focus on food <s/>
<s> my doctor gave me this prescription <s/>
<s> can i have the paper and your insurance card <s/>
<s> how long will this take to be filled <s/>
<s> we can have this filled within an hour <s/>
<s> is there any way to fill it faster <s/>
<s> i'm in so much pain <s/>
<s> unfortunately there are other prescriptions to fill <s/>
<s> what am i supposed to do for the hour <s/>
<s> we can call you when the prescription is ready <s/>
<s> so i can go home and take a nap <s/>
<s> just leave your number here at the pharmacy and we'll call you <s/>
<s> can i send someone else to pick up the prescription <s/>
<s> your medication is a controlled substance so the person needs to be over 18 <s/>
<s> it's time to start work <s/>
<s> okay where do we start <s/>
<s> the best place to start is the roof <s/>
<s> isn't that dangerous <s/>
<s> don't be afraid <s/>
<s> as long as we're careful we'll be alright <s/>
<s> but i'm afraid of heights <s/>
<s> i'll be there <s/>
<s> like i said we'll be okay <s/>
<s> okay i trust you <s/>
<s> a good roof is very important <s/>
<s> if it leaks it can ruin the interior <s/>
<s> yes i know <s/>
<s> remember uncle joe's house <s/>
<s> i sure do <s/>
<s> let's get started <s/>
<s> i'm ready <s/>
<s> why are you eating another apple <s/>
<s> you know what they say about apples <s/>
<s> no i'm afraid i don't know <s/>
<s> an apple a day keeps the doctor away <s/>
<s> especially if you throw it at him <s/>
<s> you should eat fruit; it's good for you <s/>
<s> i do eat fruit <s/>
<s> eating healthy is wonderful <s/>
<s> i don't doubt it but i still want pizza for lunch <s/>
<s> only if you eat an apple too <s/>

<s> that's the spirit <s/>
<s> you're healthier already <s/>
<s> would you be interested in donating to our candidate's campaign today <s/>
<s> can you tell me more about why you are raising money <s/>
<s> campaign ads are expensive so we want to raise money for tv ads <s/>
<s> some of those ads are so negative though <s/>
<s> you're right but the new ads are going to be positive <s/>
<s> how much money are you trying to raise <s/>
<s> we need a few thousand dollars <s/>
<s> is this the only way you are raising money <s/>

<s> would you like to go on a blind date <s/>
<s> you must be joking <s/>
<s> no i'm serious <s/>
<s> i don't want to date a blind woman <s/>
<s> a blind date doesn't mean that she is blind <s/>
<s> what does it mean <s/>
<s> a blind date is a date with someone you don't know <s/>
<s> why would i date someone i don't even know <s/>
<s> to try something new and exciting <s/>
<s> what if i don't like her <s/>
<s> then you don't date her again <s/>
<s> why are you dressed in that weird costume <s/>
<s> i'm going larping with some friends <s/>
<s> what's larping <s/>
<s> it stands for live action role playing <s/>
<s> what do you do when you larp <s/>
<s> you dress up as someone and do things in character <s/>
<s> that sounds really ridiculous <s/>
<s> it's really fun actually <s/>
<s> don't you feel silly wearing that in public <s/>
<s> it's all part of the fun <s/>
<s> while you do that i think i'll go to the arcade <s/>
<s> alright but you're missing out <s/>

<s> in fact it's chilly in the apartment too <s/>
<s> let's turn on the heat <s/>
<s> i'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut <s/>
<s> it should be warmer in a few minutes <s/>
<s> it's so nice to have a heated apartment <s/>
<s> how did they survive in the old days <s/>
<s> they had fireplaces <s/>
<s> someone had to chop the wood <s/>
<s> and carry it into the house <s/>
<s> all we have to do is flip a switch <s/>
<s> can you tell me what are the luggage limits for this domestic flight <s/>
<s> you are allowed one carry-on luggage and one personal item <s/>
<s> so i can bring this roll-away suitcase on the plane <s/>
<s> that will fit in the overhead bin so it won't cost you <s/>
<s> what is a personal item <s/>
<s> anything that will fit under the seat in front of you is a personal item <s/>
<s> can i bring my really big suitcase on the plane <s/>
<s> we will have to check that in for $35 <s/>
<s> that's not included in the cost of the ticket <s/>
<s> the first checked bag is $35 and another will be an additional $25 <s/>
<s> when i was younger everything was included in the price of the ticket <s/>
<s> times have changed <s/>
<s> are you married <s/>
<s> i'm divorced <s/>

<s> she fell in love with my best friend <s/>
<s> i liked the car but i am not happy with the price <s/>
<s> i'm sorry but that's the best we can do <s/>
<s> could you talk to your manager and have it brought down <s/>
<s> i could try but it probably won't work <s/>
<s> i can't afford $15000 <s/>
<s> the most i can spend is $10000 <s/>
<s> let me call my manager <s/>
<s> he is out of the office <s/>
<s> i can pay it all off now <s/>
<s> i don't want to be making payments <s/>

<s> they pay benefits based on your income <s/>
<s> i think the more you earn the more you receive <s/>
<s> that's interesting <s/>
<s> i didn't know that <s/>
<s> i think i may go to the edd office to ask about it <s/>
<s> you should go <s/>

<s> you should do your part in helping the environment <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> it's going to be messy though <s/>
<s> mind giving me a hand <s/>
<s> i'd be glad to <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> this is a lot to handle alone <s/>
<s> don't mention it <s/>
<s> after all one person can make a big difference to the environment <s/>
<s> i'll be sure to be more considerate next time <s/>
<s> how may i help you <s/>
<s> my computer is not letting me run javascript <s/>
<s> that can easily be fixed <s/>
<s> i've tried fixing it myself but nothing worked <s/>
<s> if you'd kindly go to our website i'll fix the problem <s/>
<s> i've logged in now what <s/>
<s> i will now access your computer from my location <s/>
<s> oh i see what you are doing <s/>
<s> that should just about fix the problem <s/>
<s> thank you so much <s/>
<s> it was such an easy solution <s/>
<s> i'm happy to help <s/>
<s> again thank you and have a good day <s/>
<s> who did you vote for for president <s/>
<s> i voted for ralph nader <s/>
<s> who in the world is ralph nader <s/>
<s> he's the best man for president <s/>
<s> why's that <s/>
<s> he hates corporations <s/>
<s> well most corporations do think only about money <s/>
<s> he hates democrats and republicans <s/>
<s> well they do put their party before their country <s/>
<s> he's the only candidate that i trust <s/>
<s> but he didn't have a chance <s/>
<s> nobody voted for him <s/>
<s> sooner or later voters will wake up <s/>
<s> what would you do if you lost your job <s/>
<s> i have no idea <s/>
<s> i've been here for 20 years <s/>
<s> do you have any other skills <s/>
<s> well i know how to flip hamburgers <s/>
<s> no one would hire you to flip hamburgers <s/>
<s> have you heard something that you're not telling me <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> are there going to be layoffs at this place <s/>
<s> i certainly hope not <s/>
<s> if you got laid off you'd be flipping hamburgers too <s/>
<s> oh great we could both work at burger king <s/>
<s> maybe we'd get laid off there too <s/>
<s> did you watch that golf tournament <s/>
<s> the one that tiger won <s/>
<s> how did he do it <s/>
<s> it was nothing for him <s/>
<s> he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke <s/>
<s> he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke <s/>
<s> i think he is from outer space <s/>
<s> no human could possibly play golf that well <s/>
<s> whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament he makes that shot <s/>
<s> no human can do that <s/>
<s> somebody should check his birth record <s/>
<s> i bet it says he was born on mars <s/>
<s> what's wrong <s/>
<s> you seem unsure about something <s/>
<s> i'm unsure of where to get off the bus <s/>
<s> where are you coming from <s/>
<s> i got on the bus in pasadena <s/>
<s> where are you heading to <s/>
<s> i'm trying to go downtown <s/>
<s> i could tell you where to get off <s/>
<s> that would be very nice of you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i'm happy to help a stranger anytime <s/>
<s> what's the street that i should get off on <s/>
<s> you're going to get off on wilshire <s/>
<s> how much further is that stop <s/>
<s> the bus is fifteen minutes away from there <s/>
<s> we're pretty close then <s/>
<s> how smart are you <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> i think i'm average <s/>
<s> did you ever take an iq test <s/>
<s> no i never did <s/>
<s> all i know is that i got a's and b's in school <s/>
<s> i wish i was really smart <s/>
<s> don't be ridiculous <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> if you're going to make a wish wish that you were really rich or famous <s/>
<s> don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart <s/>
<s> it must be very lonely <s/>
<s> why's that <s/>
<s> because if you're super-smart no one understands what you're saying <s/>
<s> i missed the tv news last night <s/>
<s> what was on <s/>
<s> nothing that would pass as news <s/>
<s> what's the weather going to be like this weekend <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> whenever the weather comes on i switch channels <s/>
<s> what was the lead story on the news <s/>
<s> some actress was in court for driving without a license <s/>
<s> what was the second story <s/>
<s> some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter <s/>
<s> what was the third story <s/>
<s> a bull chased a man in a supermarket <s/>
<s> wasn't there anything about octo-mom <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> she's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants <s/>
<s> what are you going to do about your death <s/>
<s> well mostly i'll try to avoid it <s/>
<s> i mean are you going to get buried or cremated <s/>
<s> my wife and i will be cremated <s/>
<s> are you going to be buried next to each other <s/>
<s> our ashes will be shaken into the ocean <s/>
<s> you're not going to be buried <s/>
<s> a coffin costs too much and takes up too much space <s/>
<s> yes but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you <s/>
<s> children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> a cemetery is for dead people not living people <s/>
<s> we figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach <s/>
<s> what are you getting for your mom <s/>
<s> what are you talking about <s/>
<s> sunday is mother's day <s/>
<s> this sunday <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> it's all over the news <s/>
<s> i thought it was next sunday <s/>
<s> well you'd better get her something <s/>
<s> i'll get her a nice card <s/>
<s> is that it <s/>
<s> that's all i ever give her <s/>
<s> she raised you and all you ever give her is a card <s/>
<s> it's okay <s/>
<s> she knows that i love her <s/>
<s> i don't like our flag <s/>
<s> what's the matter with it <s/>
<s> it's too much like other flags <s/>
<s> yes a lot of flags have stripes <s/>
<s> a flag should be pretty <s/>
<s> what should our flag look like <s/>
<s> it should have a pretty woman on it <s/>
<s> that's ridiculous <s/>
<s> you don't like pretty women <s/>
<s> of course i do <s/>
<s> but not on our flag <s/>
<s> every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag <s/>
<s> you can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it <s/>
<s> i had a busy morning <s/>
<s> what did you do <s/>
<s> i watered all the plants <s/>
<s> you have a lot of plants <s/>
<s> then i did my laundry <s/>
<s> that takes some time <s/>
<s> i took the dog for a walk <s/>
<s> i'll bet he enjoyed his walk <s/>
<s> i vacuumed the entire house <s/>
<s> that's a lot of work <s/>
<s> and then i made lunch <s/>
<s> i'll bet you were hungry <s/>
<s> i don't have long distance service with my home phone <s/>
<s> so how do you make long distance calls <s/>
<s> i use a calling card <s/>
<s> where do you get that <s/>
<s> i buy it at the dollar store <s/>
<s> how much is it <s/>
<s> it's one dollar for 100 minutes <s/>
<s> that's only a penny a minute <s/>
<s> it's a great price <s/>
<s> but you have to dial a lot of numbers <s/>
<s> first you dial seven numbers then ten numbers then ten more numbers <s/>
<s> i think i'll keep my long distance service <s/>
<s> let's take a walk <s/>
<s> what's the weather like <s/>
<s> let me step outside and see <s/>
<s> it's a little chilly right <s/>
<s> yes it is <s/>
<s> i'll put on my cap <s/>
<s> wear a jacket too <s/>
<s> i wonder if i should bring my gloves <s/>
<s> maybe you should just in case it gets colder <s/>
<s> i'll put a glove in each pocket <s/>
<s> we'll get warmer as we walk <s/>
<s> yes but it gets colder as the sun goes down <s/>
<s> i want to go on a cruise ship <s/>
<s> that sounds like fun <s/>
<s> where do you want to go <s/>
<s> i want to cruise to hawaii <s/>
<s> that should be a nice trip <s/>
<s> lots of fun and lots of food <s/>
<s> i have no idea how much it will cost <s/>
<s> i think it depends on the season and on your cabin <s/>
<s> well of course i want to go when the weather is nice <s/>
<s> yes you don't want to travel in winter storms <s/>
<s> and i want to get a big cabin with a view <s/>
<s> are you going to travel alone <s/>
<s> no my sister and i will travel together <s/>
<s> well you should go online and try to find a good deal <s/>
<s> here comes our food <s/>
<s> i'm so hungry <s/>
<s> it looks delicious <s/>
<s> here's your order <s/>
<s> excuse me but i don't think this order is correct <s/>
<s> what did you order <s/>
<s> i ordered the fried chicken <s/>
<s> this is grilled <s/>
<s> let me check <s/>
<s> oh yes you did order the fried chicken <s/>
<s> yes i did <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> not to worry <s/>
<s> i'll get your order out in no time <s/>
<s> please do <s/>
<s> two of us would like to eat at the same time <s/>
<s> if you like i can keep your plate warm while preparing her meal <s/>
<s> let's go for a ride <s/>
<s> where are we going <s/>
<s> into the mountains <s/>
<s> that sounds nice <s/>
<s> i want to show you my new car <s/>
<s> you bought a new car <s/>
<s> i bought a cadillac <s/>
<s> a luxury car <s/>
<s> luxury plus speed <s/>
<s> what are we waiting for <s/>
<s> let me get the keys <s/>
<s> let me get my camera <s/>
<s> hello may i speak to susan please <s/>
<s> yes this is susan <s/>
<s> this is mr jones from the abc company <s/>
<s> hello mr jones <s/>
<s> i have a job offer if you are still interested <s/>
<s> oh that's wonderful <s/>
<s> is it for the customer service job <s/>
<s> yes we would like you to start next monday <s/>
<s> it pays $15 per hour <s/>

<s> i'll take it <s/>
<s> i'll email you some literature you can read about our company <s/>
<s> oh that's great news mr jones <s/>
<s> welcome to the abc company <s/>
<s> we'll see you monday <s/>
<s> okay monday it is <s/>
<s> see you then <s/>
<s> i love playing all of these old fashioned games <s/>
<s> too bad it's so expensive <s/>
<s> i wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters <s/>
<s> i think that would lose the arcade a lot of money <s/>
<s> maybe but it would get them a lot of new customers <s/>
<s> despite the high cost these games are a lot of fun <s/>
<s> look at these old graphics <s/>
<s> it's funny to think they were once considered high-tech <s/>
<s> i used to be really good at this game when i was a kid <s/>
<s> my brother and i used to compete all the time <s/>
<s> let's see who gets a higher score <s/>
<s> maybe tomorrow <s/>
<s> i'm already out of quarters <s/>
<s> what can you tell me about the neighborhood <s/>
<s> only good things <s/>
<s> like what for example <s/>
<s> the neighborhood is a safe and clean place <s/>
<s> is there any crime <s/>
<s> there is hardly any crime that is reported <s/>
<s> i wonder why that is <s/>
<s> there is a neighborhood watch that patrols daily <s/>
<s> that explains crime disparity <s/>
<s> any other questions <s/>
<s> who are the residents living in the neighborhood <s/>
<s> mostly families and some retired folks <s/>
<s> sounds like a pleasant neighborhood <s/>
<s> it really is <s/>
<s> i hope you enjoy living there <s/>
<s> whoâ’s the greatest baseball player <s/>
<s> there are so many great players <s/>
<s> yes but who is the greatest <s/>
<s> iâ’d have to say babe ruth <s/>
<s> most people would say that <s/>
<s> he changed the game <s/>
<s> yes he made the home run popular <s/>
<s> everybody loved him all over the nation <s/>
<s> he helped make the yankees the best team ever <s/>
<s> and ruth was a good person too <s/>
<s> he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids <s/>
<s> there will never be another babe <s/>
<s> i got ripped off <s/>
<s> what happened <s/>
<s> i had a car problem so i went online <s/>
<s> did you find a solution <s/>
<s> yes i did <s/>
<s> a site i went to said they would send me the solution <s/>
<s> so what's the problem <s/>
<s> i sent them $20 using my credit card but they never sent me the solution <s/>
<s> what are you going to do <s/>
<s> i sent them an email asking for my money back <s/>
<s> have you heard from them <s/>
<s> it's been a week <s/>
<s> well i guess that's a $20 lesson for you <s/>
<s> have you seen our waiter <s/>
<s> here he comes now <s/>
<s> we've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes <s/>
<s> oops i guess i was wrong <s/>
<s> that isn't our waiter <s/>
<s> we can give him five more minutes and then leave <s/>
<s> i'll go up front and talk to the manager <s/>
<s> that's a good idea <s/>
<s> maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long <s/>
<s> maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately <s/>
<s> every time we eat out it's an adventure <s/>
<s> last time we got seats next to the kitchen <s/>
<s> we'll never go there again <s/>
<s> do your students ever talk about their jobs <s/>
<s> yes and they ask me what jobs are the best <s/>
<s> i tell my students to become a teacher <s/>
<s> teaching is a great job <s/>
<s> it's the best job i've ever had <s/>
<s> what makes it so good <s/>
<s> for me it's the students <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> i mean i have wonderful students <s/>
<s> that must be nice <s/>
<s> teaching is the best part of my whole day <s/>
<s> you're a lucky man to have a job you love <s/>
<s> can i have you license and registration sir <s/>
<s> what seems to be the problem officer <s/>
<s> you have no idea why i pulled you over <s/>
<s> i don't have any idea officer <s/>
<s> you were going 60 miles an hour and the speed limit is only 45 <s/>
<s> sorry officer <s/>
<s> i guess i was in a rush <s/>
<s> where are you rushing to <s/>
<s> i'm late picking up my kids from school <s/>
<s> i'm going to have to give you a ticket <s/>
<s> can't you just let me off with a warning <s/>
<s> i'll be more careful next time <s/>
<s> you could have caused an accident and never made it to get your kids <s/>
<s> you have a point officer <s/>
<s> i can't believe the coffee maker broke <s/>
<s> well it was a pretty old model <s/>
<s> i guess it did last quite a few years <s/>
<s> we should buy a new one <s/>
<s> do you want to buy the same model <s/>
<s> maybe it's time we upgrade <s/>
<s> what do you mean by that <s/>
<s> well now we can buy a better coffee maker <s/>
<s> what did you have in mind <s/>
<s> maybe something with more functions <s/>
<s> i would really like an expresso maker <s/>
<s> it's settled then <s/>
<s> we'll buy a new coffee maker <s/>
<s> i'm calling to see if the results of some tests i took are in <s/>

<s> yes that's right <s/>
<s> can you tell me when the tests were taken <s/>
<s> i was there last week <s/>
<s> i see your results are in mr foster <s/>
<s> can you read them to me <s/>
<s> actually i cannot <s/>
<s> you need to come in and see the doctor <s/>

<s> i'm great <s/>
<s> i wanted to thank you for going out with me last friday <s/>
<s> i'm glad you had a good time <s/>
<s> you didn't seem to enjoy it that much <s/>
<s> to be honest i didn't like the movie you picked <s/>
<s> i thought a horror movie would be a great way for us to get close to each other <s/>
<s> you were a little too hands on <s/>
<s> why don't we try again next weekend <s/>
<s> i really don't think so <s/>
<s> are you interested in going out with me again at all <s/>
<s> you should probably lose my number <s/>
<s> hi i'm calling from room 117 and there is a big problem <s/>
<s> i'm so sorry <s/>
<s> what seems to be the issue <s/>
<s> the issue is a huge disgusting cockroach in my bathroom <s/>
<s> is it just one cockroach <s/>
<s> yeah there is only one but it's the size of my hand <s/>
<s> why don't you just kill it <s/>
<s> i shouldn't have to kill cockroaches while i'm on vacation <s/>
<s> do you want me to send someone to kill it for you <s/>
<s> you can send someone but i also want to be moved to a different room <s/>
<s> i don't know if we have any other rooms available right now <s/>
<s> well i'm not staying in this room if there are gigantic roaches sharing it with me <s/>
<s> i'll send someone to your room right away to see if we can move you <s/>
<s> you are allowed two carry-on items on this flight <s/>
<s> can i bring on this suitcase <s/>
<s> it looks smaller than 45 inches so it should fit in the overhead compartment <s/>
<s> i don't want to put my computer bag in the overhead though <s/>
<s> the laptop bag can go underneath the seat in front of you <s/>
<s> it's cold in buffalo so can i bring my coat <s/>
<s> your coat doesn't count as a carry-on <s/>
<s> i have a separate bag with a tuna sandwich i just bought <s/>
<s> the bag of food doesn't count as a carry-on <s/>
<s> this pillow doesn't fit in my bag either and i need it for the flight <s/>
<s> you can bring a pillow or blanket too <s/>
<s> i forgot my blanket at home <s/>
<s> now you can only check out this magazine for one week <s/>
<s> why one week <s/>
<s> i thought the borrowing time was two weeks <s/>
<s> that's for books only <s/>

<s> i know but i like to take my time <s/>
<s> i don't make the rules <s/>
<s> would you like to check it out <s/>
<s> yes i'd like to check it out <s/>

<s> don't judge me <s/>
<s> i can't read educational stuff all the time <s/>
<s> i read time and national geographic <s/>
<s> everyone's taste is different <s/>
<s> i'm so bad at picking out gifts for my husband <s/>
<s> the eternal question of what to get for the man who has everything <s/>
<s> what do you suggest <s/>
<s> well is your husband into sports <s/>
<s> he is a huge fan of both soccer and american football <s/>
<s> well the football season is about to start <s/>
<s> how about a jersey from his favorite team <s/>
<s> that's actually a great idea <s/>
<s> just tell me what size he is <s/>
<s> he's really tall but slim <s/>
<s> how about a large then <s/>
<s> if it doesn't fit can i return it <s/>
<s> i'll include a gift receipt so he can return it too <s/>
<s> i have a new co-worker at work <s/>
<s> she's pretty <s/>
<s> is she prettier than your ex-girlfriend <s/>

<s> okay let's get this done <s/>
<s> i'm ready babe <s/>
<s> i'm sorry for being difficult <s/>

<s> yes they will <s/>
<s> after a college admits you they'll ask for your transcript <s/>
<s> i didn't know that <s/>
<s> how about my extracurriculars <s/>
<s> they'll randomly audit 10% of their applicants <s/>
<s> what does that mean <s/>
<s> the ucs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of their extracurriculars <s/>
<s> it's only 10% <s/>
<s> it's not that little <s/>
<s> you may be chosen <s/>
<s> be careful <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> it's too risky to lie <s/>
<s> i'd like to schedule an appointment <s/>

<s> i love peanuts <s/>
<s> i love them roasted and salted <s/>
<s> i love boiled peanuts <s/>
<s> i never heard of that <s/>
<s> just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft <s/>
<s> i'll have to try them sometime <s/>
<s> they're best when they're hot <s/>
<s> my brother is allergic to peanuts <s/>
<s> that's not good <s/>

<s> the streets are clean and quiet <s/>
<s> the neighbors don't party on the weekends <s/>
<s> people take care of their lawns <s/>
<s> no rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards <s/>
<s> we never have to call the police about anything <s/>
<s> our kids are completely safe <s/>
<s> so why are we selling our house <s/>
<s> they're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner <s/>
<s> so we've got to sell before property values go down <s/>
<s> i still can't believe our city council allowed this building <s/>
<s> they're probably getting something under the table <s/>

<s> thank you <s/>
<s> you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long <s/>
<s> i want to get a tan <s/>
<s> i don't want to look so pale <s/>

<s> people think you might be sick <s/>
<s> who thinks that <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>

<s> i know that <s/>
<s> so why are you arguing with me <s/>

<s> the air-conditioning doesn't work <s/>
<s> no it does not <s/>
<s> it's an easy fix though <s/>
<s> are there any other problems with it <s/>
<s> everything should be in order <s/>
<s> the power steering seems to need some fixing <s/>
<s> why do you say that <s/>
<s> it's hard to turn the steering wheel when turning <s/>
<s> you may take it to a mechanic to make sure <s/>
<s> what happens when the fire alarm rings <s/>
<s> we tell our students to leave the classroom <s/>
<s> can they take their belongings <s/>
<s> yes if they do it quickly <s/>
<s> where do the students go <s/>
<s> they go out to the north parking lot <s/>
<s> what do the teachers do <s/>
<s> we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll <s/>
<s> why do you do that <s/>
<s> we want to make sure all the students are out of the building <s/>
<s> if they are all outside then what <s/>
<s> then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in <s/>
<s> do you know where i could dispose of my trash <s/>

<s> is there a difference between the two <s/>
<s> well one is for recycling and the other is for trash <s/>

<s> it's due today <s/>
<s> i know but i don't have it right now <s/>
<s> your dog ate it <s/>
<s> i left it at home <s/>
<s> i can't take your word for it <s/>
<s> i'm an a+ student <s/>
<s> how do i know if you even did the homework <s/>
<s> i'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me <s/>
<s> that's fair enough <s/>
<s> also you should try trusting students more <s/>
<s> we're not all that bad <s/>
<s> i'll try but i can't promise anything <s/>
<s> i have a date tomorrow night <s/>
<s> a girl i met at the market <s/>
<s> you met a girl at the supermarket <s/>
<s> she was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter <s/>
<s> what did you say to her <s/>
<s> i had two pineapples in my cart and she asked where i had found them <s/>
<s> she asked you about your pineapples <s/>
<s> i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf but i offered her one of mine <s/>
<s> that was nice of you <s/>
<s> she asked me how she could return the favor so i asked her out <s/>
<s> sometimes a slow line can be a good thing <s/>
<s> i wonder what i can do to get involved in the campaign <s/>
<s> you can volunteer <s/>
<s> what does a campaign volunteer do <s/>
<s> all kinds of things like handing out pamphlets <s/>
<s> pamphlets about what <s/>
<s> about the candidate and what they stand for <s/>
<s> that sounds like it would be a great way to meet people <s/>
<s> volunteers also make phone calls and ask for money <s/>
<s> i would feel awkward asking strangers for money <s/>
<s> it's not for you <s/>
<s> it's for your candidate <s/>
<s> you have a point <s/>
<s> volunteering for a campaign is a great experience <s/>
<s> i'm bored <s/>
<s> what's on tv <s/>
<s> there must be something on tv <s/>
<s> nothing that's interesting <s/>
<s> what about that new game show <s/>
<s> which one <s/>
<s> deal or no deal <s/>
<s> tell me you're joking <s/>
<s> i love that show <s/>
<s> i watched it once <s/>
<s> that was enough <s/>
<s> it's on right now <s/>
<s> let's watch it together <s/>
<s> is this your first time riding the bus <s/>
<s> yes it is <s/>
<s> how did you tell <s/>
<s> the look on your face gave it away <s/>
<s> i really do look that confused <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to say so but don't be embarrassed <s/>
<s> you seem friendly <s/>
<s> would you mind answering a question <s/>
<s> no not at all <s/>
<s> what's your question <s/>
<s> i'm trying to get to the airport <s/>
<s> do you know where i should get off <s/>
<s> this bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport <s/>
<s> i know that it does <s/>
<s> i've just forgotten on what street <s/>
<s> the stop will say lax airport <s/>
<s> oh really <s/>
<s> that's pretty obvious <s/>
<s> excuse me <s/>
<s> this is my first time on campus <s/>
<s> where can i park <s/>
<s> there are three parking lots on campus <s/>
<s> can you point me to the direction of the nearest one <s/>
<s> keep driving straight <s/>
<s> when you get to the light make a left <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> do i have to pay <s/>
<s> the first floor has visitors parking <s/>
<s> so do i have to pay <s/>
<s> do they take credit cards <s/>

<s> thank you very much <s/>
<s> you're welcome <s/>
<s> have a nice day <s/>
<s> i don't know why i bother to vote <s/>
<s> why's that <s/>
<s> what good does it do <s/>
<s> you get to put someone in power that you like <s/>
<s> only if my candidate wins <s/>
<s> well he can't win unless you and others vote for him <s/>
<s> but even if my candidate wins he'll break his promises <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> they promise anything just so they get elected <s/>
<s> and when elected they go their own way <s/>
<s> they forget who put them in power <s/>
<s> they forget where they came from <s/>
<s> maybe you should run for office <s/>
<s> look at the car chase on tv <s/>
<s> that driver is crazy <s/>
<s> i can't believe he hasn't crashed <s/>
<s> how fast is he going <s/>
<s> they say he's going 80 miles per hour <s/>
<s> he's going to kill someone <s/>
<s> he just hit that car <s/>
<s> oh my goodness <s/>
<s> no one is safe on the streets <s/>
<s> now he's slowing down <s/>
<s> maybe he ran out of gas <s/>
<s> he just got out of the car and started running <s/>
<s> i hope the police catch him <s/>
<s> is this table okay <s/>
<s> no it's too close to the kitchen door <s/>
<s> how about this table <s/>
<s> no it's too close to the front door <s/>
<s> this looks like a nice table <s/>
<s> no it's too close to the salad bar <s/>
<s> okay i give up <s/>
<s> well there is one good table <s/>
<s> which one <s/>
<s> a group of eight just sat down at it <s/>
<s> i like living here <s/>
<s> pasadena is a nice city <s/>
<s> it's not too big <s/>

<s> it has great weather all year long <s/>
<s> it has the rose parade <s/>
<s> it has beautiful houses <s/>
<s> it has wonderful restaurants <s/>
<s> it has great schools <s/>
<s> it's close to the mountains <s/>
<s> the people are friendly <s/>
<s> i'm not ever going to leave <s/>
<s> i'm gaining weight <s/>
<s> how much have you gained <s/>
<s> three pounds just this month <s/>
<s> do you know why <s/>
<s> i think it's the ice cream <s/>
<s> you started eating ice cream <s/>
<s> it was on sale <s/>
<s> how much did you buy <s/>
<s> i filled up my freezer with ice cream <s/>
<s> well it won't last forever <s/>
<s> no i figure i'll finish it all by next week <s/>
<s> then you can start losing weight if there isn't another sale <s/>
<s> were you invited to leslie's birthday party dinner <s/>
<s> i'm really excited about it <s/>
<s> would you like to go with me <s/>
<s> do you mean as your date <s/>
<s> yeah why not <s/>
<s> you and i have been out a few times together <s/>
<s> this will be the first time we go out in front of friends though <s/>
<s> are you embarrassed to be seen with me <s/>
<s> not at all <s/>
<s> it will be really nice though <s/>
<s> i'll pick you up at 8 <s/>
<s> why so early <s/>

<s> i'm doing well thanks <s/>
<s> so what have you got for me today <s/>
<s> i have exciting news mr davis <s/>

<s> i have a serious offer on your house <s/>
<s> this may be the one <s/>
<s> how close to the asking price is the offer <s/>

<s> the offer is at $325000 <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> that's almost what we listed it for <s/>

<s> i'm ready to sell <s/>
<s> i have to tell you something <s/>

<s> i have never met a more honest student <s/>
<s> i just felt wrong <s/>
<s> just keep the score you have <s/>
<s> that's awesome <s/>
<s> i have to ask why did you decide to tell me <s/>
<s> i'm really bad at lying <s/>
<s> that's a good thing <s/>
<s> your honesty is praiseworthy <s/>
<s> want to give me extra credit <s/>
<s> don't push it <s/>
<s> i have a few questions regarding the neighborhood <s/>

<s> yes very much so <s/>
<s> that's good news <s/>
<s> can you describe how <s/>
<s> the neighborhood is abundant with plant life <s/>
<s> you mean like trees and bushes <s/>
<s> yes and not just any regular trees and bushes <s/>
<s> the ones here are beautiful <s/>
<s> anything else you can describe <s/>
<s> the streets are nicely paved and the street lights are quite quaint <s/>
<s> wow i could just picture it now <s/>
<s> the neighborhood will look even better in person <s/>
<s> open the door police <s/>
<s> what's going on <s/>
<s> we have a warrant for your arrest <s/>
<s> what's the charge <s/>
<s> you are being arrested for robbery <s/>
<s> i didn't rob anyone <s/>
<s> tell it to the judge <s/>
<s> turn around please <s/>
<s> i know my rights <s/>
<s> you have the right to remain silent <s/>
<s> how about my right to a lawyer <s/>

<s> there's no way you can come in just finish that report <s/>
<s> if i come in i may give everyone what i have <s/>
<s> well what do you have <s/>
<s> i have a really bad stomach flu <s/>
<s> eww yeah in that case stay home <s/>
<s> there're a few problems with room 217 and i'd liked to be moved <s/>
<s> maybe it's a problem we can fix without moving you <s/>
<s> if you can kill the 8 cockroaches i've seen this morning <s/>
<s> did you say 8 cockroaches <s/>
<s> are you exaggerating just a little <s/>
<s> i know how to count and i took pictures and video with my cell phone <s/>
<s> we can call an exterminator and send him to your room <s/>
<s> great and then i'm supposed to breathe in toxins after that <s/>
<s> at least you won't have any more roaches <s/>
<s> you can't be serious right now <s/>
<s> can i speak to your supervisor <s/>
<s> i can transfer your call right now <s/>
<s> can you also transfer my room <s/>
<s> i'll check to see if we have any vacant rooms we can move you to <s/>
<s> how long do you want to check that video out for <s/>
<s> one week would be nice <s/>
<s> that will be $5 <s/>
<s> i thought i could check out videos for free <s/>
<s> you can check out educational videos for free <s/>
<s> this is bogus <s/>
<s> it's still not a bad price <s/>
<s> okay what if i only borrow it for a day <s/>
<s> it will be $2 <s/>
<s> okay here's $2 <s/>
<s> so much for a library that services the public <s/>
<s> i hope you enjoy the movie <s/>
<s> for 2 bucks i'd better love the movie <s/>
<s> i'm registering for psych 21 because i need it to transfer <s/>
<s> i need that class too in order to transfer <s/>
<s> but there's only one space left <s/>
<s> that's terrible <s/>
<s> my registration time is at 5 pm <s/>
<s> mine is at 6 pm <s/>
<s> that sucks <s/>
<s> maybe someone will drop out <s/>
<s> i doubt it <s/>
<s> psych 21 is needed by a lot of people <s/>
<s> beg the professor <s/>
<s> if i have to <s/>
<s> you should cry <s/>
<s> that might work <s/>
<s> i'm planning to <s/>
<s> i can cry on demand <s/>
<s> maybe you should take a theater class instead <s/>
<s> this bus is taking so long <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> it's running late <s/>
<s> it was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago <s/>
<s> just be a little more patient <s/>
<s> i'm sure it'll arrive any minute now <s/>
<s> we're going to be so late all because of this late bus <s/>
<s> the buses usually come on time <s/>
<s> they should always be on time <s/>
<s> don't they know people depend on their swiftness <s/>
<s> just wait a little longer <s/>
<s> i'm tired of waiting <s/>
<s> this bus is never going to come <s/>
<s> complaining is not helping the situation <s/>
<s> i have every right to be complaining <s/>
<s> suit yourself then <s/>
<s> what do you think i should get for dessert <s/>
<s> i don't know look at the menu <s/>
<s> they have icecream pies cakes <s/>
<s> it looks like a great selection <s/>
<s> i don't know what to get <s/>
<s> it's kind of hot out <s/>
<s> maybe icecream would be good <s/>
<s> icecream sounds fantastic <s/>
<s> how about we go to the icecream parlor down the street <s/>
<s> that sounds good to me <s/>
<s> that pecan pie is calling my name though <s/>
<s> answer to icecream's call only <s/>
<s> you're right <s/>
<s> i have to go back upstairs <s/>
<s> we're already late <s/>
<s> i have to check the stove <s/>
<s> what's the matter <s/>
<s> maybe i left the burner on <s/>
<s> no you didn't <s/>
<s> i checked the stove before we left <s/>
<s> are you sure <s/>
<s> of course i'm sure <s/>
<s> well i have to go back upstairs anyway <s/>
<s> it's getting later every minute <s/>
<s> i think i left the water running <s/>
<s> no you didn't <s/>
<s> the only thing running is the clock <s/>
<s> can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow <s/>
<s> depends on what time you need to be at the airport <s/>
<s> well my flight leaves at 10 <s/>
<s> did you check in online already <s/>
<s> yes i checked in and i don't have any bags to check <s/>
<s> so we should leave by 9 <s/>
<s> it's an international flight <s/>
<s> oh so you need to be there two hours before your flight <s/>
<s> can you get me to the airport by 8 <s/>
<s> that's when i take the kids to school so no <s/>
<s> so how am i going to get to the airport then <s/>
<s> guess you'll have to pay for a cab <s/>
<s> that election for us senator stunk <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> there were more votes than voters <s/>
<s> but that's impossible <s/>
<s> officials said that it's possible <s/>
<s> did they explain how it's possible <s/>
<s> they said there are some things you can't explain <s/>
<s> so are they going to hold another election <s/>
<s> that will cost too much money <s/>
<s> so it's better to save money than to have an honest election <s/>
<s> well the democratic party says it was an honest election <s/>
<s> of course they say thatâ—their man won <s/>

<s> honey this steak looks delicious <s/>
<s> yes it does michael <s/>
<s> it has a nice color <s/>
<s> yum and it's perfectly cooked <s/>
<s> it looks a bit rare <s/>
<s> how did you order it <s/>
<s> medium-rare as always <s/>
<s> that looks rare to me dear <s/>
<s> it might be a bit pink on the inside but i don't care <s/>
<s> this is delicious <s/>
<s> that's all that matters dear <s/>
<s> i have to tell the waiter to send my compliments to the chef <s/>
<s> that would be a nice gesture <s/>
<s> the baked potato is also very tasty <s/>
<s> well make sure you tell the chef that also <s/>
<s> can you cut my hair a little differently this time <s/>
<s> how would you like it cut <s/>
<s> well last time it was a little too long <s/>
<s> i see what you mean <s/>
<s> how about a bob cut <s/>
<s> can you work some layers into it <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> it's easy <s/>
<s> i would also like to keep some bangs <s/>
<s> how long would you like them <s/>
<s> maybe down to my eyebrows <s/>
<s> sounds good <s/>
<s> i trust you to make me look beautiful <s/>
<s> oh trust me you'll look gorgeous <s/>
<s> i don't think i'd like to be famous <s/>
<s> it seems like a good lifestyle <s/>
<s> there would always be paparazzi following me everywhere <s/>
<s> i guess that would be really annoying <s/>
<s> it would be impossible to get any peace and quiet <s/>
<s> not to mention the lack of privacy <s/>
<s> i'd love to be in an action movie though <s/>
<s> why do you want to be in an action movie <s/>
<s> then i could say that i was a superhero <s/>
<s> i don't think anyone would believe that you're a superhero <s/>
<s> they would if i was in an action movie <s/>
<s> like i said before that's never going to happen <s/>
<s> excuse me sir <s/>
<s> how much for this lamp <s/>
<s> i'll sell it to you for $50 <s/>
<s> that's way too expensive <s/>
<s> what price did you have in mind <s/>
<s> maybe something closer to one fourth that much <s/>
<s> i might as well give it away for that price <s/>
<s> what about half <s/>
<s> that's still not enough of a profit <s/>
<s> i'll give you $30 for it <s/>
<s> make it $35 and you've got a deal <s/>
<s> alright that sounds good to me <s/>
<s> you sure drive a hard bargain <s/>
<s> did you have a date friday night <s/>
<s> yes in fact i did <s/>
<s> who did you go out with <s/>
<s> a man i met in a coffee shop <s/>
<s> where did you go <s/>
<s> we went to a nice restaurant <s/>
<s> anywhere else <s/>
<s> then we went to a jazz club <s/>
<s> that sounds like a nice date <s/>
<s> yes it was pleasant <s/>
<s> but you won't date him again <s/>
<s> he was nice but there was no chemistry <s/>
<s> boy i'm glad that job is finished <s/>
<s> how long did it take <s/>
<s> four hours without a break <s/>
<s> it's always nice to finish a job <s/>
<s> well it's good and bad <s/>
<s> what's bad about it <s/>
<s> when you finish all you do is start another job <s/>
<s> yes that's right <s/>
<s> it does get boring <s/>
<s> especially if it's the same work over and over <s/>
<s> but that's what most people do <s/>
<s> yes i guess most of us are stuck in a routine <s/>
<s> i wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over <s/>
<s> i hate to fly <s/>
<s> because of all the security <s/>
<s> no because it hurts my ears <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> every time we land or take off my ears hurt so much <s/>
<s> that's just the altitude change i think <s/>
<s> whatever it is it hurts <s/>
<s> can't you take medicine or something for it <s/>
<s> i've tried everything but nothing works <s/>
<s> have you tried earplugs <s/>
<s> they don't work either <s/>
<s> well be glad you're not a pilot <s/>
<s> i can't quit smoking <s/>
<s> of course you can <s/>
<s> i don't have enough will power <s/>
<s> of course you do <s/>
<s> i wish i had never started <s/>
<s> so does every smoker <s/>
<s> i've tried to quit so many times <s/>
<s> so has everyone else <s/>
<s> nothing seems to work <s/>
<s> all it takes is will power and you have it <s/>
<s> then why can't i quit <s/>
<s> you have to believe in yourself <s/>
<s> where's the pencil sharpener <s/>
<s> which one <s/>
<s> i need to sharpen this pencil <s/>
<s> i think there's one on the dining room table <s/>
<s> i already looked there <s/>
<s> did you look in the desk drawer <s/>
<s> yes i looked there too <s/>
<s> don't we have about five sharpeners <s/>
<s> yes but they seem to have legs <s/>
<s> tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener <s/>
<s> get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom <s/>
<s> that way it will stay where i put it <s/>
<s> i checked the whole car and it has some problems <s/>
<s> what kind of problems does it have <s/>
<s> the brakes need to be replaced as well as the power steering <s/>
<s> is that all <s/>
<s> that seems like an easy fix <s/>
<s> that's not all <s/>
<s> the alternator seems to be malfunctioning <s/>
<s> how much would it cost me to fix it all <s/>
<s> it'll cost around $300 to $400 <s/>
<s> that's not too bad <s/>
<s> is there anything else <s/>
<s> from what i can tell no <s/>
<s> i would recommend buying it <s/>
<s> let me call the seller and i will let you know if you can start <s/>
<s> i can start right away if he gives you the thumbs up <s/>
<s> he said that it's fine <s/>
<s> i will be back for the car when you're done <s/>
<s> hi baby it's joe <s/>
<s> what's up honey <s/>

<s> well i got a hold of some dodger tickets for tonight <s/>
<s> how did you manage that <s/>
<s> a friend at work was selling them <s/>
<s> he couldn't go himself <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> who are they playing <s/>
<s> they're playing the giants <s/>
<s> it should be a good game <s/>

<s> i like the mountains so we can ski <s/>
<s> i like the beach so we can swim <s/>

<s> yeah that could be a problem <s/>
<s> i had to say something since we're roommates and i'm tired of cleaning her mess <s/>
<s> i totally understand <s/>

<s> sounds like fun <s/>
<s> what time <s/>
<s> same time every saturday <s/>
<s> do you think your friends will be ok with a new guy joining <s/>
<s> we could use another player <s/>
<s> one guy hurt his knee and won't be able to play for a while <s/>
<s> ok then i'll see you next saturday <s/>
<s> hey simon <s/>
<s> what are you doing this saturday <s/>
<s> nothing much phil <s/>

<s> i'll pick you up at 4 pm <s/>
<s> thanks for inviting me <s/>
<s> hey thanks for dinner <s/>
<s> my client and i are trying to negotiate a new contract <s/>
<s> be a good listener <s/>
<s> the best way to negotiate is to listen to what the other side says <s/>
<s> you mean just let him talk <s/>
<s> ask him questions <s/>
<s> you can get a lot of information by asking questions <s/>
<s> that's a good tip <s/>
<s> many issues can get resolved if we just learn to listen <s/>
<s> i'm having a meeting with a tough negotiator today <s/>
<s> good luck <s/>
<s> do you have any tips for me <s/>
<s> what do you mean by that <s/>
<s> if you expect more from the negotiation you'll get more <s/>
<s> that makes sense <s/>
<s> if you have low expectations the outcome may not be satisfying <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> also be confident <s/>

<s> who were you talking to for an hour <s/>
<s> sam an old friend from college <s/>
<s> when is the last time you talked to him <s/>
<s> at college graduation <s/>
<s> that was 30 years ago <s/>
<s> we had a lot of catching up to do <s/>
<s> did you hear about gina taylor <s/>
<s> i can't believe she's getting a divorce already <s/>
<s> she just got married last month <s/>
<s> i thought they would get divorced after one year <s/>
<s> celebrities never stay married <s/>
<s> this actually shouldn't be big news <s/>
<s> did you hear about joe glow <s/>
<s> what happened <s/>
<s> he was arrested for drugs <s/>
<s> i didn't hear about that <s/>
<s> it's been all over the news <s/>
<s> i don't watch the news <s/>
<s> i'm not surprised he was caught with drugs <s/>
<s> he was acting strange during his last concert <s/>
<s> i missed that too <s/>
<s> ashley wants a cell phone <s/>
<s> she doesn't need a phone yet <s/>
<s> she's too young <s/>
<s> she says all of her friends have one even a nine-year old named sally <s/>
<s> what do you think <s/>
<s> i think it would be a good idea in case of an emergency <s/>
<s> she's only 10 if she has an emergency she would be with one of us <s/>
<s> did you hear the news <s/>
<s> the ceo is going to be at the presentation <s/>
<s> that's not good <s/>
<s> i'm giving the presentation <s/>
<s> you'll be fine <s/>
<s> i heard she is really picky <s/>
<s> that's what i heard too <s/>
<s> what should i do <s/>
<s> just be prepared <s/>
<s> can you listen to my presentation and let me know what you think <s/>
<s> let's get started now <s/>
<s> did you see the game last night <s/>
<s> it was amazing <s/>
<s> i can't believe we won <s/>
<s> it's our first championship <s/>
<s> we celebrated last night <s/>
<s> we set off fireworks <s/>
<s> i watched the news to see the highlights of the game <s/>
<s> i recorded the game <s/>
<s> i'm going to watch it again tonight <s/>

<s> i need to change my flight departure <s/>
<s> when do you need to go <s/>
<s> i need to leave tomorrow morning <s/>
<s> can it be a non-direct flight <s/>
<s> i would prefer a direct flight <s/>
<s> there is one direct flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7 am <s/>
<s> it's $100 more expensive <s/>
<s> i'll take it <s/>
<s> when will you be returning <s/>
<s> don't change the return flight <s/>
<s> i think we should change the vacation policy <s/>
<s> other companies have paid vacation <s/>
<s> we do not <s/>
<s> we are a small company <s/>
<s> we can't afford paid vacations <s/>
<s> paid vacations would make employees work better <s/>
<s> give employees good benefits and they will work harder <s/>
<s> you have a point but we cannot afford it <s/>
<s> this company is never going to grow if we don't take care of our employees <s/>
<s> i agree but i don't make the rules <s/>
<s> hey robert <s/>
<s> did you hear what happened in my history class today <s/>
<s> no what happened tom <s/>
<s> someone got caught cheating on the test <s/>
<s> are you serious <s/>
<s> didn't he get caught cheating last month too <s/>
<s> how did he cheat <s/>
<s> he wrote some things on his hand and mrs jones saw it <s/>
<s> what did mrs jones do <s/>
<s> she sent him to the principal's office <s/>
<s> i think they called his parents <s/>
<s> i saw them walking into the school office <s/>
<s> he's going to be in big trouble <s/>
<s> his dad is really strict <s/>
<s> do you think they are going to suspend him from school <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> but if he continues to cheat mrs jones isn't going to be able to trust him anymore <s/>
<s> not only mrs jones but other teachers too <s/>
<s> what was that loud boom <s/>
<s> there was a chemical explosion a few blocks away <s/>
<s> did anyone get hurt <s/>
<s> yeah over 50 people were injured <s/>
<s> do we need to evacuate the building <s/>
<s> don't take the elevator <s/>
<s> jennifer are you going to join the choir club <s/>
<s> no nancy <s/>
<s> you have such a beautiful voice <s/>
<s> i'm too shy <s/>
<s> you sing so well <s/>
<s> you could probably get a solo <s/>
<s> thanks for the compliment <s/>
<s> i'm scared to sing in front of an audience <s/>
<s> you're wasting your talent <s/>
<s> if i could sing like you i would join the choir <s/>
<s> my mom said the same thing <s/>
<s> you should think about it again <s/>
<s> what if i get on stage and i freeze <s/>
<s> maybe this is great way to overcome your fear <s/>
<s> i do love singing <s/>
<s> then you should join <s/>
<s> you'll make a great addition to the club <s/>
<s> ok let me think about it <s/>
<s> the choir teacher thinks you should join <s/>
<s> how does she know <s/>
<s> she never heard me sing <s/>
<s> yes she has <s/>
<s> i recorded your singing and let her listen to it <s/>
<s> did she like it <s/>
<s> she loved it <s/>

<s> how about setting and clearing the dinner table <s/>
<s> these are easy <s/>
<s> and loading and unloading the dishwasher <s/>
<s> ok do i have to do all of these things every day <s/>
<s> i want you to share these chores with your sister <s/>
<s> you can both decide which ones you want to do <s/>
<s> that's not fair <s/>
<s> why isn't this fair <s/>
<s> she's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do <s/>
<s> no she won't <s/>
<s> you don't know susie <s/>
<s> i think i want a raise in my allowance <s/>

<s> i think i'm going to have a garage sale next weekend <s/>
<s> what did you do with all of your stuff <s/>
<s> i threw half of it away and donated the other half <s/>
<s> that's a good idea <s/>
<s> maybe i'll donate the things i don't need <s/>
<s> what about the garage sale <s/>
<s> that's just going to be another chore to do <s/>
<s> i'd rather go golfing <s/>
<s> good thinking <s/>
<s> has carol signed the contract <s/>
<s> we're still working on it <s/>

<s> i want to believe it <s/>
<s> i love coffee <s/>

<s> thank you so much <s/>
<s> i look forward to hearing from you <s/>
<s> i'm sick and tired of fixing the dishwasher <s/>

<s> is there a problem <s/>
<s> i feel like i do all of the cleaning <s/>

<s> actually i don't remember his name <s/>
<s> how could you forget his name <s/>
<s> his name was buster <s/>
<s> it was a sad day when buster died <s/>
<s> i never wanted another dog after that <s/>
<s> how old was buster when he died <s/>
<s> you don't remember anything <s/>
<s> he was 14 years old <s/>
<s> i have to negotiate a deal with a client <s/>
<s> how do you think it will go <s/>
<s> i heard he is very tough <s/>
<s> do you want some advice <s/>
<s> i'm not good at negotiating <s/>
<s> make sure you do your homework <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> collect as much information before negotiation starts so you know your options <s/>
<s> that's great advice <s/>
<s> the more info you have the smarter you will look <s/>
<s> i am so angry <s/>
<s> what happened <s/>
<s> someone keeps leaving their dog's poop on my lawn <s/>
<s> that is so rude <s/>
<s> what are you going to do <s/>
<s> i am going to video record my yard and find out who the person is <s/>
<s> good idea <s/>
<s> then you can bag it up and deliver it to their house <s/>
<s> dogs are the best animals in the world <s/>
<s> no they're not <s/>
<s> cats are the best <s/>
<s> dogs are loyal and obedient <s/>
<s> cats are cute and cuddly <s/>
<s> dogs are cute and cuddly too <s/>
<s> cats are smart <s/>
<s> they can use a litter box <s/>
<s> dogs are smart too <s/>
<s> not as smart as cats <s/>
<s> i've seen many service dogs but i've never seen a service cat before <s/>
<s> actually no <s/>
<s> i'm worried about this meeting <s/>
<s> i'm meeting with a really tough negotiator <s/>
<s> be confident <s/>
<s> you can do it <s/>
<s> i'm just worried because our company really needs this contract <s/>
<s> i know we do but don't let him know how much we need it <s/>
<s> i'll look tough too <s/>
<s> don't ever let him see you sweat <s/>
<s> that will make him think you're nervous <s/>
<s> i am nervous <s/>
<s> he doesn't need to know that <s/>
<s> i cannot negotiate with this client <s/>
<s> what's the problem <s/>
<s> he is so rude <s/>
<s> when you negotiate with someone don't take things personally <s/>
<s> i know but he makes me so angry <s/>
<s> maybe that's his strategy <s/>
<s> do you know how to draw <s/>
<s> drawing is one of my hobbies <s/>
<s> i didn't know that <s/>
<s> i doodle when i'm bored <s/>
<s> can you help my son with his school project <s/>

<s> thank you <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i cannot draw at all and i was so worried about this assignment <s/>
<s> don't worry <s/>
<s> he will have an awesome castle <s/>
<s> ok christian what is your dream job if you could have any job in the world <s/>
<s> my dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country preferably in japan <s/>
<s> that's why i came to japan to learn japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in international relations <s/>
<s> after getting my master's degree in international relations i would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the ministry of foreign affairs which is a three year program and then after that hopefully come back to japan and work for the norwegian embassy in tokyo <s/>
<s> must be pretty competitive <s/>
<s> it's very competitive but i think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why i came to japan because i know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from norway living in japan and not all of them are here to study japanese they represent different companies or schools or they're missionaries so that's the track i'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end <s/>
<s> how about when you were a child what was your dream job <s/>
<s> did you want to be a diplomat when you were say 10 <s/>
<s> no when i was ten i probably didn't know what i wanted to do <s/>
<s> i was just too busy playing in the street you know having fun with my friends and these things <s/>
<s> when i was that young i really didn't have a dream job like fireman police <s/>
<s> i never really went through that stage you know <s/>
<s> i wanted to be a baseball player <s/>
<s> alright fair enough <s/>
<s> i'm still dreaming <s/>
<s> oh that's good <s/>
<s> ok jessica we're back <s/>
<s> we're gonna talk about your future <s/>
<s> what do you want to be when you grow up <s/>
<s> well um i wanna be a physician's assistant <s/>
<s> ok what is a physician's assistant <s/>
<s> well normally when you go into a into the doctor's office you wouldn't usually get well you would get your doctor all they do is check give you check-ups or you know maybe take out stitches or something not surgery <s/>
<s> you just go in and do the little things <s/>
<s> so the doctor does not have to do them <s/>
<s> oh ok so that is what you want to do <s/>
<s> and make lots of money <s/>
<s> you wanna make lots of money <s/>
<s> ok nothing wrong with that <s/>
<s> how do you become a physici physician's assistant <s/>
<s> i can't even say it <s/>
<s> it's a lot of schooling <s/>
<s> you have like six years four or six years of college and you obviously take thelike nursing and other kinds of classes like that and then you do like um two two or four years at like a hospital as a <s/>
<s> like an assistant or <s/>
<s> like like you're actually doing <s/>
<s> oh an intern <s/>
<s> an intern yeah <s/>
<s> an internship for two or four years at a hospital <s/>
<s> then that's it <s/>
<s> you finish <s/>
<s> and then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor's place and open that up or something <s/>
<s> well best wishes on becoming a physician's assistant <s/>
<s> i'm sure you'll make a good one <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> ok hello <s/>

<s> i'm really looking forward to that <s/>
<s> it's kind of the start of being independent <s/>
<s> yeah i hear you so you say permit is that the same thing as a license <s/>
<s> no you have to have your permit six months before you can get a license <s/>
<s> oh really <s/>
<s> how do you get a permit <s/>
<s> you have to take driving school then you have to go to the dmv and take a test <s/>
<s> ok what is the dmv <s/>
<s> the department of motor vehicles <s/>
<s> ok and they give you your license of permit so you can drive <s/>
<s> ok when you have a driver's license what places do you want to go to <s/>

<s> at that time you get a learner's permit <s/>
<s> and then you start driving with your parents <s/>

<s> i like holding a real book with pages <s/>
<s> e-books have pages <s/>
<s> they're not real pages <s/>
<s> paperback books have pages you can turn <s/>
<s> e-books can be read in the dark <s/>
<s> that's a good point <s/>
<s> but i still like paperback books better <s/>
<s> you'll never change <s/>
<s> i don't like e-books <s/>
<s> i love them <s/>
<s> i love the smell of paper and the feel of a paperback book <s/>

<s> here is both my address and phone number <s/>
<s> i found your item <s/>
<s> it was delivered to a different address <s/>
<s> so what will you do about it <s/>
<s> i am very sorry for the error <s/>
<s> we will send a replacement table to your correct address as soon as possible <s/>
<s> thank you for your wonderful customer service <s/>
<s> have you seen sandy <s/>
<s> we had a misunderstanding and she is not talking to me <s/>
<s> i'm sorry to hear that <s/>
<s> i said something silly and hurt her feelings <s/>
<s> what did you say <s/>
<s> it's not important <s/>
<s> i don't want to discuss it <s/>
<s> i just want to apologize to her <s/>
<s> she always hangs out at linda's house or the library <s/>
<s> i've already checked both places <s/>
<s> how about her house <s/>
<s> her roommate said she wasn't home <s/>
<s> have you called her cell phone <s/>
<s> yeah several times <s/>
<s> she must really be mad at you <s/>
<s> she stormed off and i didn't get to explain what i meant <s/>
<s> i'm really curious now <s/>
<s> what did you say to her <s/>
<s> i told her to exercise <s/>
<s> well that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman <s/>
<s> i meant that she should exercise to stay healthy <s/>
<s> that sounds better <s/>
<s> hope you find her <s/>
<s> do you have this sweater in red <s/>
<s> we do not have any more in red but i can order one for you <s/>
<s> when will it arrive <s/>
<s> it should take 3-5 business days <s/>
<s> that's perfect <s/>
<s> it is a birthday gift for my mother <s/>
<s> when is your mother's birthday <s/>
<s> in two weeks <s/>
<s> i will call you when it arrives <s/>
<s> here is my cell phone number <s/>
<s> ok i hope she likes the sweater <s/>
<s> i need a new job <s/>
<s> this job doesn't pay enough <s/>
<s> are you having money problems <s/>
<s> i don't have enough money for bills and rent <s/>
<s> but you drive a nice car and wear expensive things <s/>
<s> i need those things <s/>
<s> i don't think you need expensive things <s/>
<s> you just want them <s/>
<s> what do you mean <s/>
<s> i think you're spoiled <s/>
<s> you need to set some priorities <s/>
<s> in the fall <s/>
<s> yes because in the fall we have a celebration called naadam and that’s the best time to go <s/>
<s> and you get to see horse racing and archery and wrestling and so many tourist come to mongolia at that time <s/>
<s> okay now in your city what is one food i should definitely try <s/>
<s> well i would say khuushuur <s/>
<s> khuushuur <s/>
<s> everyone loves it <s/>
<s> and for me i love it too <s/>
<s> it looks like dumpling but fried and it’s more bigger and inside is meat <s/>
<s> so it’s like a dumpling and inside it’s meat <s/>
<s> so outside the dumpling part it is like bread or is it like <s/>
<s> it’s a flour yeah <s/>
<s> like a flour-based <s/>
<s> okay now mongolia is quite famous for meat correct <s/>
<s> so what is probably the most popular meat <s/>
<s> so not chicken not fish <s/>
<s> we don’t really eat chicken and we don’t eat fish <s/>
<s> well we have a river fish <s/>
<s> it’s like really delicious but then we don’t have sea so seafood is not popular at all <s/>
<s> so people mainly eat beef <s/>
<s> so when i’m there in your country what place should i go to <s/>
<s> like what should i see <s/>
<s> probably [it’s] better to go to the countryside because if you go to ulan bator it’s just the same as other cities -- other cities around the world <s/>
<s> but the countryside is a whole different world <s/>
<s> and the countryside is where you can see the mongolian tent and horses like nomadic places like where people live in the outside <s/>
<s> that’s the best place for foreigners to go <s/>
<s> is there anything i should buy <s/>
<s> like what would be a good souvenir or gift from your country <s/>
<s> well in the department stores they have sections for mongolian traditional gifts and stuff so probably you can get the tent -- a small tent <s/>
<s> a little tent <s/>
<s> yeah and then if you open the door you can actually see all the furniture is inside it <s/>
<s> so it’s kind of interesting <s/>
<s> wow like a little doll house <s/>
<s> okay wow it sounds good <s/>
<s> i hope to go <s/>
<s> let's have another backyard barbeque this weekend <s/>
<s> ok that sounds fun <s/>

<s> christian can you talk about the summers in norway <s/>

<s> it gets close to 30 degrees centigrade and which is enjoyable i guess and there's no humidity <s/>
<s> it's nice and dry and it's just pleasant weather really <s/>
<s> yeah and what we do in the summers is different <s/>
<s> some people have a house on small islands on the coast or some people have a house on the mountains and you can either go to the mountains and enjoy the lakes the forests or you can go to the coast and enjoy the beach the water go fishing so there's plenty of things to do in the summer yeah and we get a lot of tourist coming in the summer though because it's not that hot <s/>

<s> so how do you make it <s/>
<s> well you use ricotta cheese mozzarella cheese um parmesan cheesea little bit of salt and basil and stuff and you mix it all together in a pot and then you stuff it in the noodle and you put the noodle in the pan and shove it in the oven for 35 minutes and let it cook <s/>
<s> and it's good <s/>
<s> that sounds really good <s/>
<s> how often do you make manicotti <s/>
<s> oh a couple times a month probably <s/>

<s> in a pan you put garlic onions olive oil and tomatoes <s/>

<s> i will send you a reminder tomorrow morning <s/>
<s> in mongolia we don’t have elementary school secondary school or high school divided into three parts but we have from 1st grade until 12th grade in one school so we don’t really call them like high school or secondary school or elementary school <s/>
<s> and for the high school like from the 8th grade until 12th grade well they study what other students study in different countries but nowadays they are focusing on more like english studies or different language studies <s/>
<s> how long is a typical class <s/>
<s> do you have let’s say six classes a day each class is one hour <s/>
<s> we start school at 8 <s/>
<s> and then what do you do in the afternoon <s/>
<s> we go back <s/>
<s> you go home <s/>
<s> yes ‘cause in mongolia we have two parts <s/>
<s> in the morning the high school students go to the school and from 1 <s/>
<s> oh so you split the school <s/>
<s> so do teachers sometimes have to teach both levels <s/>
<s> that’s tough <s/>
<s> so when you go home do you usuallydo have family there waiting or do usually both parents work <s/>
<s> in mongolia the mother and father they usually work and when i finish my school i just go back and make my own food because in mongolia mothers’ work is not to like stay at home or do housework <s/>
<s> kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and wash their clothes and that’s your work and usually the mothers don’t do that kind of thing <s/>
<s> oh so the children have to do all that work <s/>
<s> actually it’s quite similar i think in the us pretty much <s/>
<s> so what about your study load <s/>
<s> do you have a really heavy study load <s/>
<s> like do you have two hours of homework a night or <s/>
<s> it really depends on the school but for me like i was studying in an international school so i had to study quite hard to get the level still <s/>
<s> so for me i studied after schooli’d rather study at night so i studied like 3 or 4 hours at night <s/>
<s> so that’s my study habit <s/>
<s> that’s a lot <s/>
<s> not really compared to other students <s/>

<s> i'm looking for some materials to make a solar system <s/>
<s> a solar system <s/>
<s> yeah david has a science project <s/>

<s> how about some balls <s/>
<s> they can represent the planets and the sun <s/>
<s> i was looking for some foam balls but i can't find any in our garage <s/>
<s> i might have some <s/>
<s> judy had to make a solar system model a few years ago <s/>
<s> i might have some balls left over <s/>
<s> that would be great <s/>
<s> david wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board <s/>
<s> that's what judy did too <s/>
<s> was judy in mrs johnson's science class <s/>
<s> she must have the students do the same project every year <s/>
<s> it's a great project <s/>
<s> we had a fun time doing it together <s/>
<s> are there eight or nine planets now <s/>
<s> when i was a child pluto was a planet <s/>
<s> but it's not considered a major planet anymore <s/>
<s> i think scientists are still debating that issue <s/>
<s> david should ask his teacher <s/>
<s> good idea <s/>
<s> let me go look for the balls <s/>
<s> i think i still have her model in the garage too <s/>
<s> i'll be right back <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> i'll keep looking in my garage too <s/>

<s> it takes all day <s/>
<s> do your kids help too <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> they look through their closets and toy bins to find clothes and toys to donate or throw away <s/>
<s> that's a great idea <s/>
<s> but why is it called spring cleaning <s/>
<s> because it's done in the spring season <s/>
<s> i think we're going to start doing this too <s/>
<s> our house is so cluttered <s/>
<s> after we have the things ready for donation jim takes them to the local homeless shelter <s/>
<s> this makes the house easier to clean <s/>
<s> that's great <s/>
<s> i'm going to tell my family about this <s/>
<s> well i better get started <s/>
<s> i have a lot to do <s/>
<s> talk to you later sharon <s/>
<s> bye jill <s/>
<s> thanks for the cleaning tip <s/>
<s> now mini you are from sri lanka <s/>
<s> if somebody is going to your country can you recommend three things they should do or three things they should see <s/>
<s> ok the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the kings and queens built like castles <s/>
<s> we have a castle called it's called the rock castle <s/>
<s> it's called sigirya so it's very beautiful <s/>
<s> this is the rock castle <s/>
<s> yeah it's the castle is on the rock itself so you can see the ruins there <s/>
<s> it's really beautiful with pictures paintings arts and stuff <s/>
<s> oh really <s/>
<s> that's really cool so this rock castle how old is it <s/>
<s> i'm not sure but maybe around two thousand <s/>
<s> i'm not sure <s/>
<s> what else should people you see <s/>
<s> the second thing should be beaches <s/>
<s> we have beautiful beaches all over the place blue clean <s/>
<s> you can swim <s/>
<s> you can surf <s/>
<s> it's very beautiful <s/>
<s> that's the second thing <s/>
<s> surfing is popular in sri lanka <s/>
<s> i mean not popular amongst sri lankans but most of the many tourists come especially the germans they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap <s/>
<s> food is cheap <s/>

<s> he was a great employee <s/>
<s> they're going to miss him at the office <s/>
<s> what are you and dad going to do now <s/>
<s> i think we're going to take a trip to hawaii <s/>
<s> that's good <s/>
<s> it's a great place to relax <s/>
<s> it sure is <s/>

<s> can our company afford this <s/>
<s> the ceo wants to keep our clients happy <s/>
<s> that's definitely going to keep them happy <s/>
<s> it'll probably attract more clients to our company too <s/>
<s> i need some tips on negotiating <s/>
<s> ok don't be in a hurry to end negotiations <s/>
<s> i hate negotiating <s/>
<s> i want it to be over quickly <s/>
<s> if you're in a rush you're more likely to make mistakes <s/>
<s> that's true <s/>
<s> i made a bad deal once because i was in a hurry <s/>
<s> if you show them patience they will think you are not under pressure to make a quick deal <s/>
<s> they will start to give you what you want because they think you don't need their offer <s/>
<s> that's also true <s/>
<s> this is great advice <s/>
<s> just take your time <s/>
<s> there's a lot of money involved so you don't want to make any mistakes in your negotiations <s/>
<s> thank you <s/>
<s> these are great negotiating tips <s/>

<s> he said mean things to tom <s/>
<s> tom asked john a question <s/>
<s> john didn't have to be so honest <s/>

<s> can you take the kids to school today <s/>
<s> the plumber is coming at 8 am <s/>

<s> when you drop katie off you have to walk her to her classroom <s/>
<s> because she is in kindergarten and the school does not allow them to be dropped off in the parking lot <s/>

<s> that's right yeah i'm not yakuza though so don't worry <s/>
<s> what's the reasoning behind the tattoo <s/>
<s> why did you get it <s/>
<s> i got the tattoo because i used to actually work as a tattooist a long time ago but now i stopped that so i can come traveling <s/>
<s> i designed the tattoo myself <s/>
<s> i drew it onto paper then i got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body <s/>
<s> i got a wolf really because i really love animals and a wolf is my favorite animal <s/>
<s> so you drew the tattoo <s/>
<s> i drew the tattoo yeah <s/>
<s> did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body <s/>
<s> yeah it did hurt but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was <s/>
<s> the chest is probably the worst place which is where my tattoo is so it hurt <s/>
<s> why is the chest the worst place <s/>
<s> because there's not much meat there kind of because there is a lot of bone <s/>
<s> and the closer to the bone it is and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be <s/>
<s> can we share this cab <s/>
<s> where are you going <s/>
<s> to 5th avenue and main street <s/>

<s> but i also have to carry fish and you know um carrying ice and put put ice um yeah and preserve fish <s/>
<s> wow what time do you start work <s/>
<s> wow that's pretty early <s/>

<s> ok kerri i'm going to ask you about the news <s/>
<s> do you follow the news every day <s/>
<s> sometimes <s/>
<s> how do you follow the news <s/>
<s> well in japan mostly the radio or the internet <s/>
<s> oh really <s/>
<s> ok what radio station <s/>
<s> npr but on the military station <s/>
<s> ok and what internet websites do you listen to <s/>
<s> well usually it is just ap news or whatever <s/>
<s> ok how much of the news do you think is true <s/>
<s> i don't know <s/>
<s> that's a tough question <s/>
<s> i think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public <s/>
<s> how do most people in your country get the news <s/>
<s> i think most people in the states get the news from tv and from the main broadcasting stations <s/>
<s> the evening news sort of thing <s/>
<s> ok thanks keri <s/>
<s> i would like to make a haircut appointment with ann <s/>
<s> ann does not work here anymore <s/>

<s> does he have a train set <s/>
<s> he has several trains and jason built him a big wooden train track <s/>
<s> then he's going to love this ride <s/>
<s> we haven't told him yet <s/>

<s> tell her that babies cannot eat candy <s/>
<s> she said halloween is boring <s/>

<s> where are you and janice going <s/>
<s> just around our neighborhood <s/>
<s> there are a lot of homes around here <s/>
<s> we live in an apartment <s/>
<s> maybe that's why it's boring <s/>
<s> there aren't many kids here <s/>

<s> it's very relaxing <s/>
<s> i like being in the city <s/>
<s> do you want to try a new restaurant tonight <s/>
<s> i'm kind of getting sick of the same place <s/>
<s> what kind of food do you want to eat <s/>
<s> do you want to try indian <s/>
<s> ok i've never had indian food before so you'll have to choose the place <s/>
<s> i've never had it before either <s/>
<s> then why do you want to go there <s/>
<s> to try something different <s/>
<s> let's check out the reviews online <s/>
<s> that's a good idea <s/>

<s> i'll be working all week and on the weekend <s/>

<s> he is my favorite actor <s/>
<s> he is a good actor but he is not very popular <s/>
<s> he is so underrated <s/>
<s> why is he underrated <s/>
<s> i think it is because he's not very handsome <s/>
<s> i don't think that is true <s/>
<s> there are many popular actors who are not handsome <s/>
<s> maybe it is because he always plays the bad guy <s/>
<s> people like good guys <s/>
<s> he is very good at playing an evil guy <s/>
<s> that is what makes him a great actor <s/>
<s> but he needs to play other types of roles <s/>
<s> i love this restaurant <s/>
<s> it is so underrated <s/>
<s> not too many people know about it <s/>
<s> people do not know how great the food is here <s/>
<s> don't tell anyone <s/>
<s> this place will get crowded <s/>
<s> i hate crowded places <s/>
<s> however if this place doesn't get more customers they may go out of business <s/>

<s> i know but i still feel uncomfortable about it <s/>
<s> i would really like to see you there <s/>

<s> i feel the same way <s/>
<s> if you don't go to the reunion maybe i can visit you <s/>

<s> i've only been here for nine months but i would like to take one week off next month <s/>
<s> is it a medical situation <s/>
<s> no my parents live in italy and it's their 50th wedding anniversary <s/>
<s> you can take one week off with your supervisor's approval but it will not be a paid week <s/>
<s> where is your favorite vacation spot <s/>
<s> i like going to my parents' lake house <s/>

<s> return the vacuum and buy her jewelry <s/>
<s> i think i want the blue car instead <s/>
<s> i thought we agreed to buy the red one <s/>
<s> i like the blue one better <s/>
<s> you always change your mind <s/>
<s> this is an expensive purchase <s/>
<s> what if you change your mind again after we buy it <s/>
<s> i promise i won't change my mind <s/>

<s> i can go to the beach <s/>
<s> i can relax with my friends outside <s/>
<s> it's very nice <s/>
<s> ok what is your least favorite season <s/>
<s> my least favorite season in japan is the rainy season because i don't like rain at all <s/>
<s> ok what season are we in right now <s/>
<s> right now it is the very end of winter <s/>
<s> it is just starting to become spring <s/>
<s> what's the weather like today <s/>
<s> today it's very sunny <s/>
<s> it's a little cool <s/>
<s> a little breezy <s/>
<s> it's very nice <s/>
<s> i enjoy it <s/>
<s> hello anne <s/>
<s> can you explain something to me <s/>
<s> what is it <s/>
<s> what is halloween <s/>
<s> it's a holiday that we celebrate once a year <s/>
<s> is it the same date every year <s/>
<s> it's on october 31 <s/>
<s> what do people do on that day <s/>
<s> people dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy <s/>
<s> even strangers' homes <s/>
<s> they knock on the doors and say 'trick or treat' <s/>
<s> then the home owner gives out candy <s/>
<s> do adults do it too <s/>
<s> not many adults <s/>
<s> it's usually just children <s/>
<s> isn't that unsafe <s/>
<s> it can be <s/>
<s> but parents go with them <s/>
<s> my son wants to do it this year <s/>
<s> i didn't know what it was <s/>
<s> you don't do this in your native country <s/>
<s> i guess it's a new tradition we have to learn <s/>
<s> it's a lot of fun <s/>
<s> your son will enjoy it <s/>
<s> hey john what are you doing <s/>
<s> oh hi lee <s/>
<s> i'm setting up tables and chairs for a family bbq <s/>
<s> is it a special occasion <s/>
<s> tomorrow is the fourth of july <s/>
<s> i know that tomorrow is july 4 but what is so important about it <s/>
<s> you don't know <s/>
<s> it's our country's independence day <s/>
<s> what do you mean independence day <s/>
<s> on july 4 1776 our country's founders declared independence from the rulers of great britain <s/>
<s> how did america declare independence <s/>
<s> we went to war against great britain called the revolutionary war and won <s/>
<s> i didn't know that <s/>
<s> so now the united states celebrates this day every year <s/>
<s> how do you celebrate <s/>
<s> we usually have a big bbq party <s/>
<s> then we light fireworks when it gets dark <s/>
<s> oh those loud and colorful explosions in the sky <s/>
<s> would you like to come over and watch them with our family <s/>
<s> can i bring my children too <s/>
<s> of course <s/>
<s> they will enjoy them <s/>
<s> but it is very dangerous so we have to watch the kids carefully <s/>
<s> i have a question about thanksgiving <s/>
<s> what does that day mean <s/>
<s> it's an american holiday that's celebrated once a year <s/>
<s> what is the date <s/>
<s> there is no actual date <s/>
<s> it is different every year <s/>
<s> it is on the fourth thursday in november <s/>
<s> that's interesting <s/>
<s> why do americans celebrate this day <s/>
<s> it first started many years ago after the pilgrims settled in america <s/>
<s> they wanted to celebrate the first harvest after settling in america <s/>
<s> oh i see <s/>
<s> is there anything special americans do on that day like fireworks on the 4th of july <s/>
<s> we typically roast a whole turkey and make lots of other dishes like potatoes and stuffing <s/>
<s> that sounds like a feast <s/>
<s> can your family eat all of that <s/>
<s> we invite our relatives and celebrate this day together <s/>
<s> it's like a family reunion <s/>
<s> and pumpkin pie is usually the dessert because pumpkins are in season in the fall <s/>
<s> it sounds like a nice tradition <s/>
<s> nowadays many people celebrate this day to give thanks for all of their blessings like family and good health <s/>
<s> i like this tradition <s/>
<s> maybe i will roast a turkey this year <s/>
<s> will you teach me <s/>
<s> i would love to <s/>
<s> i have many great recipes i can share with you <s/>
<s> i'm nervous about this trip <s/>
<s> i'm meeting with the cfo <s/>
<s> that would make me nervous too <s/>

<s> what else <s/>
<s> bring a nice suit <s/>
<s> i don't own a suit <s/>
<s> well you better go shopping then <s/>
<s> i'd like to return these boots <s/>

<s> they are very uncomfortable <s/>
<s> i think you have had these for a long time <s/>
<s> it looks like you have already worn them a lot <s/>
