Text Processing.py contains the code for pre processing of text which includes sentence segmentation.
It took text from the corpus folder which contains 8 different instances of
small talk. The corpus contains around 25000 sentences with around 150000 words.
The output of Text Processing.py is contained in corpusProcessed.txt.

n-gram.py contains the main n-gram model for both, unigram and bigram.
This program takes in the input corpusProcessed.txt and forms a corpus 
in a dictionary form. The functions in the program file will guide
to how the program works.

In short, run the generateUnigram() function in the n-gram.py to generate words based on unigram model.

run the generateBigram() function in the n-gram.py to generate words based on the bigram model.
